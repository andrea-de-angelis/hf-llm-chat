Why Publishers Are Turning to Native Advertising for Revenue Growth

August 25, 2022

RevContent Team

Today, traditional display advertising is becoming increasingly irrelevant. Brand advertisers want flexibility, great content, video, images, and infographics; all at a reasonable price. This is why publishers are turning to native advertising to grow their revenue.

Native advertising involves creating ads that are in line with the page content. They are built into the page design and are consistent with the platform. This gives the impression that the ad belongs on the page.

Both established brands and startups are shifting more ad budgets toward non-disruptive advertising formats. Native ads offer immense benefits to advertisers and publishers.

In this post, we bring you the advantages of native advertising, plus tips for publishers.

Native Advertising Benefits for Publishers

Native advertising budgets are rising with every passing year and are expected to double in the next few years.

Reports from Statista indicate that the expenditure on native display ads in the U.S. touched $52.75 billion in 2020, up from $16.68 billion in 2016. It is expected to grow 36% by 2022.

Publishers who have a customer base are looking to monetize their sites. Advertisers are looking to achieve brand awareness and generate more leads.

Native advertising has become an indispensable tool for publishers to monetize their content across platforms and devices.

Here is how native ads can benefit you as a publisher:

Generates Revenue: Unlike banner ads, native ads blend in with a page’s content. They are eye-catching, interactive, and relevant to the customer’s needs, without being intrusive. They encourage visitors to click on them; thereby, potentially generating revenue for publishers. According to Sharethrough , customers view 53% more native ads than regular display ads.

Offers Higher Engagement: Per Martechvibe, 70% of users prefer to learn about products via native ads. With opt-in native units, you can drive users to high-value pages and rich media content, such as native images, videos, carousels, sponsored content, and microsites, without sacrificing the overall user experience.

Presents Transparency and Simplicity: In-feed ads are a great way for publishers to showcase their content. Native advertising platforms have algorithms matching the pages and sponsored content. That makes them easy to use. Because they are clearly labeled as sponsored content, it creates a sense of transparency among users. They click on the advertisement, knowing that it is a paid ad.

Is More User-Friendly: User-friendly, native ads blend in with organic content, making them less likely to be blocked and more likely to be viewed.

Helps Monetize Content: Since native ad placements offer high earnings per 1000 impressions (eCPMs), greater engagement, and better click-through rates, advertisers are willing to spend more on them. This allows publishers to monetize content without changing their layout.

Offers More Control: Native ads give advertisers more control over ad placement and where the ads will be used. Publishers can benefit by selecting the most relevant ads for the target audience. This will help them convert visitors more easily.

Is Device Responsive: Native ads run flawlessly on mobile websites. These ads appear as part of a site’s content and look like the original content. That means one piece of effective ad content will work on all types of devices, mobile or otherwise.

Gives Higher Returns with Email Marketing: Combining native ads with email marketing benefits publishers. Advertisers willingly pay more for the increased flexibility and customer engagement that email marketing has to offer. Delivering newsletters can help drive enhanced user experience, resulting in higher returns for the advertiser. This, in turn, will give publishers a higher cost per mille (CPM).

Tips for Native Ad Publishers to Increase Revenue

The effectiveness of native ads depends on several factors, including placement, ad size, and optimization.

Here are 9 useful tips for native ad publishers to earn more revenue:

1. Make Your Ads Relevant

Make your ads relevant and useful to your niche audience. Find ways to tell your audience what it is that makes the product or service unique and how it can help them. End the content with a clear call to action. It will potentially give you more click-throughs.

Ensure that your native ad does not disrupt the viewer experience and that it is a smooth, seamless, and hassle-free process.

2. Work on Building Customer Relationships

Rather than making a quick conversion, you should focus on building mutually beneficial long-term relationships with your customers.

First and foremost, respect their right to privacy. Avoid collecting data by using cookies . Instead, build trust by being transparent with them. Let your customers know what data you will be collecting and how you will be using it.

Take it forward by offering them a great user experience, resolving their issues promptly, and offering them loyalty bonuses and rewards.

3. Advertise on Multiple Networks

Visitors eventually ignore default ad positions and creatives, resulting in fewer clicks and lower publisher revenue.

You should consider creating multiple ads so that your campaign never gets monotonous. You will also be able to increase visitor engagement by using a variety of different ad networks.

Consumers will notice newer ads and be more inclined to click on an advertisement they have never seen before. That can potentially lead to a higher click-through rate.

Further, if you use ad rotation, it will limit the chance of users becoming blind to ads after seeing them several times in the past.

4. Experiment with Ad Placement

It is important to experiment with different ad placement and other creatives, to see what works best for you. If your advertisement matches the look and feel of your website, and is also attractive and easy to use, visitors may unconsciously click on it.

Test all ad layouts or placements, and play around with different ad sizes and units. Track user behavior based on each layout. Keep testing different types of ad combinations and choose the ones that are the most effective for your business.

5. Implement a Content Recommendation System

Your website may do well with in-feed ads, but adding more story views is the more effective way to grab eyeballs.

Stories give users more ways to navigate your website. You can use this social media tool to help consumers find specific ads on your social networks.

Sponsored stories perform equally well with a revenue model based on a per-click basis. Visually appealing, the networks offer fluid designs that blend seamlessly with your website’s aesthetics.

Additionally, ensure that your content is shareable. Placing social media links on your website will help users reach you, post comments and reviews, and share your company information on their social networks.

6. Test, Test, and Test Some More

Every site has a unique way to increase its ad revenue. One thing that publishers typically ignore is split testing. Split testing helps you view and understand the various ad metrics.

An advertisement has several elements to it. There isn’t just one thing you can do to optimize your commercials. You need to keep testing and altering your ad to optimize it. A slight change to the headline, font, color, image, landing page, or text, could sometimes change the entire personality of your advertisement.

Keep experimenting till you arrive at the combination that best suits your business.

7. Use Automation

Automation is a good way to optimize your website’s ads to determine what strikes the right chord with your audience. Automating your native ad can optimize it, test multiple ad units, track changes, schedule changes, and view results in real-time.

Machine-learning-driven optimization has become more robust than ever before. By analyzing user behavior, these systems can continually optimize your website.

8. Tips for Website Optimization

Declutter Your Website Layout: An organized website layout will help visitors understand the information, links, and tabs on your site. Make sure that the content is well-organized, and that the text is formatted to look uniform. Leave space between text blocks, so that the site looks clean and open. Use legible fonts that are easy to read. Use bulleted lists to enable viewers to browse important information.

Make Site Navigation Easy: Organize your site with clearly-categorized links and tabs. Make your site’s navigation more fluid and intuitive. Consider creating a sidebar on your homepage, plus an FAQ section.

Provide Contact Information: Post your address, customer service phone numbers, email address, and hours of operation. You can also create a customer contact form, which visitors can use to post their questions to you. A live chat or chat bot feature will allow them to get answers to their queries.

Include CTA Buttons: Include a call-to-action (CTA) button to encourage visitors to take action. Your CTA button can let them contact you to receive a product/service quote, visit another page on your site, or sign up for a paid subscription. Place the button in the same place on all your site’s pages and make them consistent across all pages.

9. Play by the Rules

Make sure to follow FTC’s guidelines on advertising; especially, on deceptively formatted ads . Not following its rules could result in serious consequences.

Also, search engines need you to disclose your paid links. So, make sure to follow the links on your advertisements.

Increase Publisher Revenue with Native Advertising

Adopt the above-mentioned native advertising techniques to generate high-quality leads and enhance publisher revenue.

Advantages of Glass Fabrics for Industrial Applications

Glass fabrics have many beneficial properties which have made them a preferred material for many industrial applications. Though highly durable, they remain lightweight, provide excellent thermal insulation, and can be easily molded into complex shapes. This blog will discuss some of the most common applications for glass fabrics .

Glass Fabrics for Aerospace and Aircraft Applications

Glass fabrics are a primary substrate for the interior structure of the fuselage in many types of aircraft. Several vital products throughout the aerospace industry rely on fiberglass for its strength, dimensional stability, corrosion resistance, and lightweight nature. In terms of aerospace applications, E-glass and S-2 glass are of particular importance in aerospace applications. These two types of fiberglass provide the fiber toughness, impact resistance, and compressive and tensile modulus required for many aerospace applications.

Glass fabrics see broad use throughout the aerospace industry to manufacture parts such as:

Aircraft flooring

Cargo liners

Ducting

Enclosures

Helicopter rotor blades

Structural aircraft parts, as well as interiors

Tooling

Growing demand from the aerospace industry has significantly contributed to the development of S-2 glass, E-glass, and other high-performance fibers. Rising demand ensures that the mechanical properties of these composites for aerospace are continually being evaluated and optimized for performance.

Glass Fabrics for Other Industrial Composite Applications

Glass fabrics have uses throughout a diverse selection of industrial applications beyond the aerospace composites market. Varying application requirements across industries have led to the use of many different types of glass to target specific physical properties. This versatility and adaptability makes glass fabrics useful in industries such as:

Automotive and Transportation

Glass fabrics play an important role in reducing the weight of vehicles and improving their strength-to-weight ratios. Fiberglass is on average three times less dense than steel, while still displaying a high level of tensile strength. Glass fabrics also increase sound dampening and fire resistance. The material’s abrasion resistance makes it particularly useful for brake pads and clutches.

Glass fabrics are a key component in high-tech, high-performance automotive electronics, and they’re also used to create fiberglass-reinforced tires. These tires display greater damage resistance than non-fiberglass reinforced varieties and deliver more stable performance. Fiberglass is used in the manufacture of many other modes of transportation also, such as trains and trams. In these applications, fiberglass is frequently chosen for its strength-to-weight ratio and fire resistance. It also functions well in applications where aerodynamics are important.

Power Generation

Many areas throughout the power generation industry rely on fiberglass due to its non-conductive properties. Fiberglass fabrics withstand extreme environmental conditions and provide excellent temperature insulation. Mica-backed glass tapes insulate turbines and electric motors, and fiberglass fabrics are also used in pipe wrapping applications. Other applications include sound dampening, thermal blankets, spray shields, and heat reflectors.

Recreation

Glass fabrics provide functional solutions for many recreational applications due to their high strength-to-weight ratio. For example, surfboards, fishing poles, and golf clubs all require durable lightweight materials. Fiberglass is used throughout many sporting applications to provide athletes with equipment that functions optimally without cracking or breaking.

Ballistics (Protection)

Glass fabrics meet a range of threat-level protection needs and help create products that offer reliable ballistic protection. These high-performance fabrics are suitable for a range of applications, from law enforcement and military to industrial protection. Ballistic fabrics offer a lightweight, high-strength solution that is comfortable for the wearer and protects against many types of threats, including bullets, cutting, piercing, abrasion, and blunt-force trauma.

Electronics

Throughout the electronics industry, glass fabrics are used as a non-conductive insulator on printed circuit boards (PCBs). Fiberglass reinforcements provide high-temperature resistance and add strength to PCBs. These fabrics are also valuable due to their low cost and compatibility with custom finishes for chemical compatibility.

Glass fabrics have many beneficial properties which have made them a preferred material for many industrial applications. Though highly durable, they remain lightweight, provide excellent thermal insulation, and can be easily molded into complex shapes. This blog will discuss some of the most common applications for glass fabrics .

Glass Fabrics for Aerospace and Aircraft Applications

Glass fabrics are a primary substrate for the interior structure of the fuselage in many types of aircraft. Several vital products throughout the aerospace industry rely on fiberglass for its strength, dimensional stability, corrosion resistance, and lightweight nature. In terms of aerospace applications, E-glass and S-2 glass are of particular importance in aerospace applications. These two types of fiberglass provide the fiber toughness, impact resistance, and compressive and tensile modulus required for many aerospace applications.

Glass fabrics see broad use throughout the aerospace industry to manufacture parts such as:

Structural aircraft parts, as well as interiors

Growing demand from the aerospace industry has significantly contributed to the development of S-2 glass, E-glass, and other high-performance fibers. Rising demand ensures that the mechanical properties of these composites for aerospace are continually being evaluated and optimized for performance.

Glass fabrics have uses throughout a diverse selection of industrial applications beyond the aerospace composites market. Varying application requirements across industries have led to the use of many different types of glass to target specific physical properties. This versatility and adaptability makes glass fabrics useful in industries such as:

Glass fabrics play an important role in reducing the weight of vehicles and improving their strength-to-weight ratios. Fiberglass is on average three times less dense than steel, while still displaying a high level of tensile strength. Glass fabrics also increase sound dampening and fire resistance. The material’s abrasion resistance makes it particularly useful for brake pads and clutches.

Glass fabrics are a key component in high-tech, high-performance automotive electronics, and they’re also used to create fiberglass-reinforced tires. These tires display greater damage resistance than non-fiberglass reinforced varieties and deliver more stable performance. Fiberglass is used in the manufacture of many other modes of transportation also, such as trains and trams. In these applications, fiberglass is frequently chosen for its strength-to-weight ratio and fire resistance. It also functions well in applications where aerodynamics are important.

Many areas throughout the power generation industry rely on fiberglass due to its non-conductive properties. Fiberglass fabrics withstand extreme environmental conditions and provide excellent temperature insulation. Mica-backed glass tapes insulate turbines and electric motors, and fiberglass fabrics are also used in pipe wrapping applications. Other applications include sound dampening, thermal blankets, spray shields, and heat reflectors.

Glass fabrics provide functional solutions for many recreational applications due to their high strength-to-weight ratio. For example, surfboards, fishing poles, and golf clubs all require durable lightweight materials. Fiberglass is used throughout many sporting applications to provide athletes with equipment that functions optimally without cracking or breaking.

Glass fabrics meet a range of threat-level protection needs and help create products that offer reliable ballistic protection. These high-performance fabrics are suitable for a range of applications, from law enforcement and military to industrial protection. Ballistic fabrics offer a lightweight, high-strength solution that is comfortable for the wearer and protects against many types of threats, including bullets, cutting, piercing, abrasion, and blunt-force trauma.

Throughout the electronics industry, glass fabrics are used as a non-conductive insulator on printed circuit boards (PCBs). Fiberglass reinforcements provide high-temperature resistance and add strength to PCBs. These fabrics are also valuable due to their low cost and compatibility with custom finishes for chemical compatibility.

Glass fabrics provide a high-performance, adaptable solution to applications throughout many industries. Their valuable characteristics make them uniquely suited for many applications. To see how our selection of glass fabric solutions can benefit your project, please contact us today.",2.81,703

Intern Testimonies

Noah Schank

Noah grew up in Arcadia, Wisconsin on a large dairy farm that sparked his passion for agriculture. This led him to attend Iowa State University to study Agriculture Business. Noah heard about the internship opportunities at NEW Cooperative through attending an ISU Career Fair. He was attracted to the large scale of the company and how broad the opportunities they offered were. A normal day for Noah is; reporting to Blairsburg location seed shed, where the first part of his day is spent helping around the shop, talking to customers, loading trucks, loading chemicals, ect. He then goes to crop scout fields taking population counts, along with checking for weeds, bugs, and any areas of concern while doing this he is taking reports of his findings to show customers.

Noah’s favorites part of his internship was “All of the people I have met, along with NEW Cooperative letting us go to DKU Days, where I can go learn from the seed representors about the different varieties in more detail. I also liked the industry tour and how our intern group is able to connect throughout the summer at different planned events, because at the end of the day we need to make connections with one another.”

Noah feels the biggest benefit of working with NEW Cooperative is “Learning from people in the industry, how they present themselves and work through the different obstacles in the day. I think it is going to be vital to my future career.”

Glasgow Prestwick Airport supports national rail safety campaign

Thursday 29 March, 16:22 Europe/London

Glasgow Prestwick Airport is the only airport in Scotland to have its own rail station.

With over 100 trains stopping at our station each and every day, and half price rail travel from anywhere in Scotland, more and more of our air passengers are choosing to take advantage of the ease and cost savings offered by using or rail link to arrive and depart from the airport.

Designed by government, police and the rail industry, a UK-wide campaign seeks to help build a more vigilant network on railways across the country and raise awareness of the vital role the public can play in keeping themselves and others safe.

Jules Matteoni, Operations Director, said:

“Here, at Glasgow Prestwick Airport, safety is our number one priority and we are proud to be part of the government’s nationwide campaign aimed at encouraging train passengers and station visitors to report any unusual items or activity.”

“To help raise awareness of the campaign, passengers arriving at our rail station will notice ‘See It. Say It. Sorted’ posters and our on-line followers will see regular posts promoting campaign messages urging rail users to report anything unusual either in person to rail staff, or by texting 61016 or calling 0800 40 50 40 .”

This campaign is initially focused on users of the rail network, but the airport plans to introduce similar messaging targeting customers and staff within the airport.

Malcolm Hadwin, Glasgow Prestwick Airport’s Security Training and Compliance Manager for the Airport said:

“As part of the airport’s ongoing commitment to the safety and security of all our passengers, concessionaires and fellow colleagues, we are working with the Department for Transport, British Transport Police, Police Scotland, Network Rail and ScotRail to help keep the UK’s rail network safe by promoting the ‘See it. Say it. Sorted’ campaign. Our rail station visitors and on-line followers will regularly see these safety messages and as we widen the campaign beyond our rail station and into the airport, we’ll introduce similar messaging through posters and public announcements across the whole site.

“The UK boasts one of best safety records for both air and rail travel. By supporting this campaign and working with colleagues from partner agencies alongside the travelling public, we can all work together to ensure that this remains the case.

“Our message is that we urge people using the rail station and the airport to report any security concerns they may have to a member of rail staff, airport staff or to the police. Your safety remains our number one priority.”

Adrenal Fatigue Part 6: Is Cortisol to Blame For Your Blood Sugar Balance or Weight-Loss Resistance?

Authored and Medically Reviewed by Brie Wieselman, LAc, MTCM

This is Part 6 of an 8-part series about Adrenal Fatigue (HPA-Axis Dysregulation), how it relates to your health, how to know if it’s impacting you, and what you can do to fix it!. Click here to read parts one , two , three , four , and five .

When Mary came to see me, she was extremely frustrated because, despite cooking most meals at home, and exercising most days of the week, she just couldn’t’ seem to get rid of the 10 extra pounds that she was carrying, mostly around her hips and stomach.

“I get it,” I told her. Hey, I’m a woman too, and while my priority is to be healthy and to feel good, I’m not gonna lie, I want to stay fitting into my date-night jeans too!

In post number 3 in the series, I mentioned how one of cortisol’s main roles in Fight-or-flight is to keep higher levels of circulating glucose in the blood for fuel. It does this by inducing a process known as gluconeogenesis, where fatty acids and amino acids are converted into useable blood glucose in the liver.

Generally, when our blood glucose levels rise, our pancreas secretes insulin to move the glucose into cells for storage, so that it can be used later during periods of activity. Having elevated cortisol long term leads to consistently higher glucose levels, which leads to consistently elevated insulin levels, as the body attempts to get glucose out of the blood and into storage. The purpose of the stored carbs is to generate a source of rapid fuel for the body. This is required if you, say, need to run from a bear.

But what if the bear isn’t a bear, but is rush hour traffic that‘s making you late for an important presentation. Rather than running down the highway to burn off some of your excess adrenaline, you’re forced to sit there and feel anxious as the minutes tick by. Now you’re just sitting still, with high blood sugar levels circulating, and no good use for them.

After a while, your body recognizes that you’re not using the liberated glucose. Your body then pumps out higher levels of insulin, to transport the glucose into fat cells to be stored. When you have high insulin and high cortisol levels your body typically stores this energy in fat cells located around the midsection or belly. Overall weight gain, or weight loss resistance are also common. To add insult to injury, adipose tissue can actually generate it’s own cortisol, jump-starting a vicious circle of chronically elevated cortisol that makes fat just impossible to budge.

Chronically high levels of insulin can also lead to a pre-diabetic condition called metabolic syndrome (or insulin resistance) and type 2 diabetes, which also leads to increased weight gain. Because of the relationship to blood sugar regulation, anyone with diabetes, pre-diabetes, whether overweight or thin, should have their adrenals tested and seek treatment if necessary.

Chronic stress also impacts appetite-regulating hormones like ghrelin and leptin, affecting our levels of hunger and satiation, as well as food preference.

If you’re struggling to lose weight, despite your best efforts, testing your cortisol levels may provide you with valuable insights into what’s getting in the way of your weight loss, and how to fix it!

Stay tuned for the final posts in the series, where I’ll discuss different types of testing, and some simple-but-powerful steps you can take to start to heal adrenal fatigue on your own.

Huffington Post

This month, leaders from Austin, Bellingham, Boston, Charlotte, Cleveland, Guadalajara (Mexico), Mountain View, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Vancouver gathered in Portland, Ore. for the first-ever EcoDistricts Institute, a meeting where they examined neighborhood-scale development projects in each of their cities.

The leaders at the institute are developing what are called EcoDistricts, which are also known as “green neighborhoods” or “green districts.” EcoDistricts integrate green buildings and smart infrastructure (energy, water, waste, recycling, transportation, etc.) with community action and civic entrepreneurism. EcoDistricts can be established within brownfield redevelopment areas, campuses or existing neighborhoods. READ FULL STORY

How to See Kemble’s Cascade With A Telescope?

Posted on January 29, 2023 February 8, 2023 by James

Kemble’s Cascade is an asterism in the constellation Camelopardalis featuring more than 20 stars, with the open cluster NGC 1502 at one end. This star pattern is an unofficial arrangement of stars known as an asterism and is not one of the recognized constellations in the night sky. HIP 18505 is the star in the center of Kemble’s Cascade with a magnitude of +4.9, which spreads from it to the southeast and northwest by degrees. The primary “structure” is made up of stars between mag. +7 and +8, but fainter members as low as mag. +10 supports the illusion of a straight line. Low-power telescope views are recommended since they show off the gorgeous star colors.

Quick Guide to Observe Kemble’s Cascade.

Kemble’s Cascade is best spotted in the early evenings of November and December with binoculars or a small telescope. Head north and find the two stars that make up the ends of the constellation. Imagine a line from Epsilon Cassiopeiae to Beta Cassiopeiae (Caph) (Segin). Imagine drawing a second line that is almost the same length as the first and travels in the same direction. Use your telescope to look for Kemble’s Cascade in the area where the line stops. Low-power telescope views are recommended since they show off the gorgeous star colors.

How to find Kemble’s Cascade?

Kemble’s Cascade is easily spottable in the sky. However, you can use any star map like Stellarium, SkySafari, and so on to find it. The Night Sky can help you personalize a custom star map that will display the alignment of the stars you prefer on the specific location and date you choose.

Face north when you step outside on any clear, dark night this month. Even though Kemble’s Cascade is in the constellation Camelopardalis, you will probably only be able to see four of its stars unless you are viewing from a place with a dark sky that is largely free of light pollution.

Depending on the time of night or season you are observing, the constellation Cassiopeia can either resemble the letter M or the letter W. Simply choose the letter you prefer because the constellation is currently standing on end in the early evening.

Locate the two stars that make up the constellation’s endpoints. Draw an imaginary line from Beta Cassiopeiae (Caph) to Epsilon Cassiopeiae (Segin).

Next, draw a second imaginary line that is nearly the same length as the previous one and runs in the same direction.

With your telescope, search the region where the line ends to find Kemble’s Cascade. Depending on the size of the telescope you’re using, it will appear as a diagonal string of 15 to 25 stars that is about 2.5 degrees long and is equivalent to five full moons lined up in a row (this is why the Cascade is best seen with the wider field of view provided by telescopes rather than the more constrained eyepieces).

What is the best time to observe Kemble’s Cascade?

Stars appear to descend in a vertical cascade into the open star cluster NGC 1502 at the foot of Kemble’s Cascade. The best times to observe it with binoculars or a small telescope are in the early nights of November and December. Find the two stars that make up the constellation’s ends by facing north. Imagine a line from Epsilon Cassiopeiae to Beta Cassiopeiae (Caph) (Segin). Imagine drawing a second line that is almost the same length as the first and travels in the same direction. It will look like a diagonal string of 15 to 25 stars, roughly 2.5 degrees long and equivalent to five full moons lined up in a row, depending on the size of the telescope you’re using (this is why the Cascade is best seen with the wider field of view provided by telescopes rather than the more constrained eyepieces).

What telescope to see Kemble’s Cascade?

Both the Meade 6″ f/4.1 LX85 Reflector and the Orion 09007 SpaceProbe 130ST Equatorial Reflector are excellent telescopes for viewing Kemble’s Cascade. A list of telescopes has more telescope options that can see Kemble’s Cascade very clearly.

What size telescope to see Kemble’s Cascade?

With a 70mm telescope, you can view Kemble’s Cascade extremely clearly. The greater the aperture, the clearer and better the vistas and details.

What magnification is required to see Kemble’s Cascade?

A 50x magnification is sufficient to display the entire Kemble’s Cascade. To observe the details, 150x magnification is preferable. Most observers prefer a lower magnification, but if you have an eyepiece with a large field of vision, you can increase this.

Enjoying Kemble’s Cascade? Here are other things to see with your telescope.

Without a doubt, the vista of Kemble’s Cascade is magnificent. However, you may see thousands of jewels in the night sky with the same telescope. The moons and other features of the planets of our solar system can be seen best. The greatest ways to watch the largest planet in our solar system may be found in Viewing Jupiter Through A Telescope. You can learn how to locate different nebulae with a scope by reading Viewing Nebula Through A Telescope . To make the most of your time stargazing, pick any of the objects from the ‘List of things to see with a telescope’ instead.

Resilience and Environmental Factors

In Sports by Brock Bourgase July 7, 2010

The recent World Cup has proven to be an excellent opportunity to showcase resilience (or lack thereof). Asamoah Gyan may have missed a penalty shot over the net because of the high altitude or the defective Jabulani ball but he still needed to compose himself, take control of the situation, and score another penalty minutes later.

Resilience allows individuals to persevere in the face of adversity. Sport and play helps youth experience “to experience social competence, empathy, caring, problem-solving skills, critical and creative thinking, task mastery and a sense of purpose and connectedness” for the rest of their lives (Henley, Schweizer, de Gara, & Vetter, 2007). Self-efficacy is strongly related to exercise behavior. In many ways, we are how we play — and vice-versa (Horn, 2002, pp. 108-9). Athletes who can handle tough circumstances, realizing that they control the situation become people who overcome adversity later on.

Modelling the Way: In the Quarter-Final match against the Netherlands, the Brazilian team experienced some misfortune and collapsed, from the coach out. Victim of a handful of poor officiating decisions and an own-goal, Brazilian coach Dunga banged the plexiglass behind his bench and marched along the sideline in frustration. Soon, the players began to complain and give up on more and more battles for loose balls, eventually losing the game. Coaches must lead by example, mirroring the personality than they want their team to show. If the court is different from expectations and shots are not falling, the coach should remain calm and adjust tactics. If the officials are intimidated by the home crowd and making questionable calls, the coach should be confident and reasonable.

Create a Team Atmosphere: Players should always feel that they are part of something greater. Players from an at-risk environment don’t need help losing but need role models. In the huddle (at home or on the road), every team member should understand that they depend on each other in order to succeed.

Reframe the Situation: Reframing a situation allows athletes to see the situation from a different perspective and see opportunities amidst threats. Every situation contains several openings (Jensen, 2003, p. 29). The climate may be hot and tiring but both teams are equally fatigued. The gym may be loud and threatening but it is also a chance to achieve self-actualization goals.

Reassure and Recognize: Perceived threats can trigger fear of failure/feelings of inadequacy, social evaluation, and external control/guilt (Martens, Vealey, Burton, 1990, p. 79). Players need only feel threatened by a new situation – like a hot and humid climate or travelling for the first time – for performance to be impaired. Coaches should always support players and reassure them understand that the situation is beatable. When an athlete makes a good effort to overcome a situation, such as ignoring noise and taking leadership on the court, they should be recognized for their efforts, irrespective of the result.

Affiliate Marketing

Affiliate Marketing is the most effective form of advertising on the internet as it offers advertisers an easy, effective and accurate way of controlling their ad-spend and measuring their R.O.I.

Traditional forms of display advertising are effective in their own right but affiliate marketing is quickly becoming the defacto option for small, medium and big companies and organisations.

The most notable aspect of affiliate marketing in respect to an advertiser is the 'Control' it offers an advertiser. Setting overall media budgets, assigning prices for a desired action, sale or lead, monitoring the activity in real-time and measuring the return on investment are powerful features, which come as standard with affiliate marketing.

There are several different affiliate marketing advertising models that can be deployed to make the most out of a campaign ( see advertising models for more information ).

""There is no nobler creature in all of Terisiare."" —General Jarkeld, the Arctic Fox

All Sales (including Pre-orders) are Final. One of the ways that we are able to provide competitive prices and free shipping on many orders is by ensuring our order accuracy and by making smart inventory purchases on our end.

We understand that sometimes orders are placed by mistake, whether you purchased the wrong quantity of something, used the wrong payment method, etc. Because we ship out items very quickly in most cases we can only accommodate a short cancellation period. We prefer if you can contact us to cancel the order immediately before we pull it off the shelf and pay for postage. For orders that do not contain a pre-ordered item we require SAME DAY cancellation. For orders that contain a pre-ordered item you have 48 hours from the time the order is submitted to cancel it.

If you have any questions before placing an order or a pre-order through our store please call us first at 480-219-4082.

You can always contact us for any question at customersupport@baxtersrealm.com

Preorders

When you make a purchase that is a pre-sale or a pre-order of an item, we are not able to ship that item to you until the manufacturer allows us to mail it out. Please check each individual item for the estimated release date for it before placing your order. Please note that we are not in control of the official release dates as a retailer, and these sometimes change due to manufacturer issues, distribution or supply chain problems, etc. They are based on actual dates provided to us either directly by the product manufacturer or our designated distributor. Sometimes there are production delays or shipping delays that can push these dates further back than what was originally projected by the manufacturer or distributor, and those are outside of our control as a retailer.

Orders that contain multiple items with a preorder will be subject to a hold until the last release date of any preordered items. If you place an order containing currently available products AND preorder items we will not ship your currently available items until your preorder is ready. If you would like your currently available items sooner, just place separate orders so we can calculate shipping properly and send out your available items right away.

Wrong Item Please inspect your order upon reception and contact us immediately if you receive the wrong item, so that we can evaluate the issue and make it right.

Exceptions / non-returnable items Certain types of items cannot be returned. Please get in touch if you have questions or concerns about your specific item.

Exchanges The fastest way to ensure you get what you want is to return the item you have, and once the return is accepted, make a separate purchase for the new item.

Refunds Refunds only apply if we shipped you the incorrect item. We will notify you once we’ve received and inspected your return, and let you know if the refund was approved or not. If approved, you’ll be automatically refunded on your original payment method. Shopify Payments can take approximately 7-10 business days to process, depending on your financial institution. This timeframe is completely outside of our control as a retailer. Please remember it can take some time for your bank or credit card company to process and post the refund too.

No Guarantees of Future Value

We make no guarantee or claims about the future value of any items sold. With collectibles in particular, these markets can fluctuate up and down in price, and Baxter's Games does not make any predictions or claims or any future value. By purchasing an item through our store, you are in agreement that the terms of that purchase (including final price) are fair, and that you understand that the value may change up or down at a later date. Market prices are outside of our control, and we cannot be held liable for any positive or negative fluctuations in the market.

Only Purchase What You Can Afford

Please make responsible purchases. Do not buy more than you can afford at the time of purchase, and do not commit to buy something that you do not have the ability to pay for. We do not recommend purchasing more than you need. We hate to see when people purchase large quantities of items based on speculation, or based on using future earnings to cover the cost of. In the end, we are selling toys, books, games, and things that are for entertainment purposes only. We are not selling investments, or any goods that are meant for re-sale or re-distribution.

USPS Insurance on Domestic Orders

If you would like to have your package insured by the USPS it is YOUR responsibility to pay for the insurance. We have included this option at checkout called either ""First Class with Insurance"" for items that do not qualify for our Free Standard Shipping, or ""Add Insurance to Free Shipping"" for those that wish to insure the packages that qualify for our Free Standard Shipping. The fees are calculated based on the item's values in your purchase and the price that USPS charges for those insurance rates. If you DO NOT choose to insure your package, we do not arbitrarily add it to any orders that we mail out.

USPS or other carrier claims for lost, stolen, or damaged packages

It is YOUR responsibility to file a claim with USPS or the other applicable carrier if your package has been lost, stolen, or damaged. If the package says it was delivered but it never showed up, your local carrier needs to investigate where they placed the package and correct their mistake. If the package was stolen, that means that a crime occurred (crimes are not a Customer Service issue, they are a legal matter), and you need to report crimes like that to your local law enforcement as well as your mail carrier. If you are the victim of a crime, YOU have to open the case yourself, we cannot advocate for you. If the package was damaged during shipping, please photograph the package before opening it, and retain all packaging until the postal carrier has closed its case on your claim. It is your responsibility to open a claim with the mail carrier since you are the one in possession of the damaged product and you have all of the applicable evidence.

You can file your claim with USPS here: https://www.usps.com/help/claims.htm

Mail and Wire Fraud Will Be Prosecuted

Attempting to use mail as a means to commit fraud or scheming to defraud a person or business is a felony in the United States with a 10 year statute of limitations according to the Department of Justice 9.43-000 . Attempts to defraud our business or our customers will result in all evidence and materials being turned over to the investigating parties. DON'T DO IT, it is not worth it.

Bridge over the First Quebrada with Grey Glacier in background

As ecotourism increased, Torres del Paine National Park’s resources became severely strained. Every year after the snow melted, Park rangers had to re-establish hiking trails through the deep gorges (“quebradas”) on ‘the Circuit’ — the major trail in the park. A bridge on the first gorge, near the foot of Grey Glacier, was high on the Park’s list of urgent needs. The bridge would greatly improve safety for hikers, offer a fantastic view of Grey Glacier, and encourage visitors to explore this gorgeous section of the Park, relieving overcrowding in other areas. But the Park simply did not have the money.

Richard Braunlich, a ConservationVIP volunteer, structural engineer, and hiking enthusiast, volunteered hundreds of hours helping the Park build this bridge. First he completed a site survey in 2009. He then prepared detailed designs for the suspension bridge. Here is a sketch of his design:

In 2010, we raised more than US$11,000 to fund construction of a pedestrian suspension bridge over the quebrada. A $7,500 grant came from the Tourism Cares Foundation , and ConservationVIP collected more than $3,700 from generous individuals.

Richard spent six weeks in late 2011 in the Park, working with Chile’s National Park Service (CONAF) on the initial phase of construction. During this first construction phase, the two towers for the suspension bridge were built. To see photos for this phase, check out the photo album on our Facebook page. To read our report to Tourism Cares about the construction completed in 2011, click here .

The final construction was completed in January 2013 . During this second phase of construction, the cable was draped across the quebrada, the rock anchorages which hold the cables in place were built, and the deck was laid. Check out the completed project on our Facebook page .

What Was Next?

The Second Quebrada farther north on the trail had a worse crossing! In early 2015, we tackled this problem.

More Info

Torres del Paine has been designated a Reserve of the Biosphere by UNESCO because of its exceptional ecological significance. Dramatic granite mountain spires, spectacular glaciers, and haunting winds draw tourists from around the world. The park is home to the guanaco, the Andean condor, the endangered huemul, and the elusive puma. For more information, see our Torres del Paine Volunteer Trip.

Back in 2013 Asianboxing.info was set up to help connect Western fight fans with the sport in Japan, Thailand, Philippines, China and Indonesia, among other countries. Since then we've grown from a basic news website to having one of the largest boxing video libraries out there, adding constantly to our collection, we've also flirted with interviews, and began doing regular weekly features.

Now before I go any further, I need to make it very, very clear, Asianboxing.info is not asking you for any money to run the basic site, that will ALWAYS BE FREE we do however want to add to what we do, and offer more to our readers. To do that we do need more funding than the basic advertising revenue we've managed to generate so far, and as a result we've got two options for those who want to directly support the site in a financial manner.

Firstly there is the donate button. This is for those who want to make a 1-off donation to the site to help pay for things, like the upkeep of the site, the growth, and the feeds we need to pay to have (this is particularly notable for the G+ videos we provide).

Secondly we have started a Patreon to help with the growth and upkeep, and help fund some of the big ideas we have for the future. Patreons will be rewarded for their donations, on a thank you page, as well as receiving other benefits down the line, including a members only section, the chance to nominate article ideas and ask questions for future Q&A's.

If you can't financially help but still want to support the site, things like sharing articles, retweets and facebook shares do go a long way to helping us increase our audience, which is a lot more support than you may realise.

As we begin 2020 we want to grow, we want to add more, we want to build on what we've been doing, and we know we need your help to do everything we want to do!

Thank you

Celebrate and spread awareness of the role bats play in the ecosystem during Bat Week from October 24-31, 2021! Bats are vital to our environment and economy and can be found worldwide with more than 1,400 species, 47 of which can be found across the United States.

Bats help pollinate important plants and reduce the amount of insect pests. They are busy workers saving American farmers over $3.7 billion a year! And, over 300 plant species rely on bats to pollinate their flowers, including wild bananas, cloves, avocados, mangos, balsa wood, and agave.

Yet, bats are in decline nearly everywhere they reside. White-Nose Syndrome, the greatest threat to bats in North America, is killing bats as they hibernate in caves and mines. Many bat species are also currently endangered, 24 are critically endangered, 53 endangered, and 104 vulnerable to endangerment. These amazing animals need our help. During Bat Week 2021, act and be a Bat Hero!

Bats are vital to our health, environment, and economy, and they need our help

There is a pressing need to help wildlife, especially misunderstood species like bats. The great news is that you do not have to have superhero powers or a lot of money to help them. There are many actions both great and small that you can take to help bats and their natural habitats.

Join in the 2021 Bat Week Celebration and do something that will make a difference! Throw a Bat Week Virtual Party and get others excited about bats. You can feature bat-themed games, share food and drink recipes that are all made possible by bats, and maybe even have a video costume contest.

Get a group of friends together and build a bat house or plant a garden just for bats . Are you more interested in daily actions that you can take to help bats? Try one of these Do It Yourself Activities !

A hero can be anyone—a person who spends a career studying bats, a teacher sharing information about bats, a neighborhood that plants gardens and trees, or a courageous student who decides to take action to help bats. Anyone can become a hero to bats and the night sky!

Some well-known places to see bats emerge are Carlsbad Caverns National Park, New Mexico; Sauta Cave National Wildlife Refuge, Alabama; or at the Congress Avenue Bridge in Austin, Texas.

Jer-Lindy Farms LLC of Brooten, Minn., Named 2017 Innovative Dairy Farmer of the Year

(Washington, D.C. – January 12, 2017)

Jer-Lindy Farms LLC of Brooten, Minn., has been selected as the 2017 Innovative Dairy Farmer of the Year by the award’s co-sponsors, the International Dairy Foods Association and Dairy Herd Management magazine. The award recognizes U.S. dairy producers that apply creativity, excellence and forward thinking to achieve greater on-farm productivity and improved milk marketing.

“We’re pleased to honor Jer-Lindy Farms with this award for two reasons,” said Michael Dykes, D.V.M., IDFA president and CEO. “The owners found innovative ways to expand and keep younger family members engaged in the operations. They also have initiated several sustainability efforts to boost efficiency and profits while continuing to be good stewards of the land and the animals.”

Jer-Lindy Farms may be one of the smallest operations to receive the award. Owners Jerry and Linda Jennissen manage the farm with 200 cows and nine part-time employees, while their daughter Alise and son-in-law Lucas Sjostrom operate the Redhead Creamery in a building across the driveway from the milk-room and parlor. Adding the creamery, which makes cheddar, brie and munster cheese, in 2013 gave the family the opportunity to expand and diversify the business without adding cows or acres.

The owners also have initiated a variety of sustainability efforts to maximize efficiency and profits while continuing to be good stewards of the land and animals. For example, Jer-Lindy Farms uses manure to fertilize its 258 acres, saving the operation $85-$160 per acre per year, which it previously spent on commercial fertilizer. The owners also found new ways to re-use water and heat, helping to minimize the farm’s environmental impact. The whey byproduct from the creamery is fed to the cows, cutting down both feed costs and waste.

“The families’ goal is to be innovative and sustainable while profitable, and they are setting an example of how small operations can achieve this goal,” said Lucas Lentsch, CEO of Midwest Dairy Association, who nominated the operation.

Jer-Lindy Farms will be featured in the January issue of Dairy Herd Management magazine, and the owners will receive the award later this month at the Celebrating Excellence Luncheon during Dairy Forum in Orlando, Fla.

Previous winners of the Innovative Dairy Farmer title are Mason Dixon Farms, Gettysburg, Pa. (1999); Clauss Dairy Farms, Hilmar, Calif. (2000); Baldwin Dairy/Emerald Dairy, Emerald, Wis. (2001); Si-Ellen Farms, Jerome, Idaho (2002); Pagel's Ponderosa Dairy, Kewaunee, Wis. (2003); C Bar M Dairy, Jerome, Idaho (2004); North Florida Holsteins, Bell, Fla. (2005); KF Dairy, El Centro, Calif. (2006); Joseph Gallo Farms, Atwater, Calif. (2007); KBC Farms, Purdy, Mo., (2008); High Plains Dairy, Friona, Texas (2009); Haubenschild Dairy Farm, Inc., Princeton, Minn. (2010); Brubaker Farms, Mount Joy, Pa. (2011); Sweetwater Valley Farm, Philadelphia, Tenn. (2012); McCarty Family Farms, Rexford, Kan. (2014); and Hilmar Jerseys, Hilmar, Calif. (2015) and Holsum Dairies of Hilbert, Wis. (2016).

A call for nominations for the 2018 Innovative Dairy Farmer award will be released this summer.

# # #

The International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA), Washington, D.C., represents the nation's dairy manufacturing and marketing industries and their suppliers, with a membership of 550 companies within a $125-billion a year industry. IDFA is composed of three constituent organizations: the Milk Industry Foundation (MIF), the National Cheese Institute (NCI) and the International Ice Cream Association (IICA).

Jer-Lindy Farms LLC of Brooten, Minn., Named 2017 Innovative Dairy Farmer of the Year

Jer-Lindy Farms LLC of Brooten, Minn., has been selected as the 2017 Innovative Dairy Farmer of the Year by the award’s co-sponsors, the International Dairy Foods Association and Dairy Herd Management magazine. The award recognizes U.S. dairy producers that apply creativity, excellence and forward thinking to achieve greater on-farm productivity and improved milk marketing.

“We’re pleased to honor Jer-Lindy Farms with this award for two reasons,” said Michael Dykes, D.V.M., IDFA president and CEO. “The owners found innovative ways to expand and keep younger family members engaged in the operations. They also have initiated several sustainability efforts to boost efficiency and profits while continuing to be good stewards of the land and the animals.”

Jer-Lindy Farms may be one of the smallest operations to receive the award. Owners Jerry and Linda Jennissen manage the farm with 200 cows and nine part-time employees, while their daughter Alise and son-in-law Lucas Sjostrom operate the Redhead Creamery in a building across the driveway from the milk-room and parlor. Adding the creamery, which makes cheddar, brie and munster cheese, in 2013 gave the family the opportunity to expand and diversify the business without adding cows or acres.

The owners also have initiated a variety of sustainability efforts to maximize efficiency and profits while continuing to be good stewards of the land and animals. For example, Jer-Lindy Farms uses manure to fertilize its 258 acres, saving the operation $85-$160 per acre per year, which it previously spent on commercial fertilizer. The owners also found new ways to re-use water and heat, helping to minimize the farm’s environmental impact. The whey byproduct from the creamery is fed to the cows, cutting down both feed costs and waste.

“The families’ goal is to be innovative and sustainable while profitable, and they are setting an example of how small operations can achieve this goal,” said Lucas Lentsch, CEO of Midwest Dairy Association, who nominated the operation.

Jer-Lindy Farms will be featured in the January issue of Dairy Herd Management magazine, and the owners will receive the award later this month at the Celebrating Excellence Luncheon during Dairy Forum in Orlando, Fla.

Previous winners of the Innovative Dairy Farmer title are Mason Dixon Farms, Gettysburg, Pa. (1999); Clauss Dairy Farms, Hilmar, Calif. (2000); Baldwin Dairy/Emerald Dairy, Emerald, Wis. (2001); Si-Ellen Farms, Jerome, Idaho (2002); Pagel's Ponderosa Dairy, Kewaunee, Wis. (2003); C Bar M Dairy, Jerome, Idaho (2004); North Florida Holsteins, Bell, Fla. (2005); KF Dairy, El Centro, Calif. (2006); Joseph Gallo Farms, Atwater, Calif. (2007); KBC Farms, Purdy, Mo., (2008); High Plains Dairy, Friona, Texas (2009); Haubenschild Dairy Farm, Inc., Princeton, Minn. (2010); Brubaker Farms, Mount Joy, Pa. (2011); Sweetwater Valley Farm, Philadelphia, Tenn. (2012); McCarty Family Farms, Rexford, Kan. (2014); and Hilmar Jerseys, Hilmar, Calif. (2015) and Holsum Dairies of Hilbert, Wis. (2016).

A call for nominations for the 2018 Innovative Dairy Farmer award will be released this summer.

The International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA), Washington, D.C., represents the nation's dairy manufacturing and marketing industries and their suppliers, with a membership of 550 companies within a $125-billion a year industry. IDFA is composed of three constituent organizations: the Milk Industry Foundation (MIF), the National Cheese Institute (NCI) and the International Ice Cream Association (IICA). IDFA's nearly 200 dairy processing members run nearly 600 plant operations, and range from large multi-national organizations to single-plant companies. Together they represent more than 85 percent of the milk, cultured products, cheese, ice cream and frozen desserts produced and marketed in the United States. Visit IDFA at www.idfa.org .",3.14,785

parmed.gromacs package ¶

Submodules ¶

parmed.gromacs.gromacsgro module

parmed.gromacs.gromacstop module

Module contents ¶

Contains classes for parsing GROMACS topology and parameter files

class parmed.gromacs. GromacsGroFile [source] ¶

Bases: object

Parses and writes Gromacs GRO files

Methods

id_format (filename)

Identifies the file as a GROMACS GRO file

parse (filename[, skip_bonds])

Parses a Gromacs GRO file

write (struct, dest[, precision, nobox, combine])

Write a Gromacs Topology File from a Structure

static id_format ( filename ) [source] ¶

Identifies the file as a GROMACS GRO file

Parameters

filename str

Name of the file to check if it is a Gromacs GRO file

Returns

is_fmt bool

If it is identified as a Gromacs GRO file, return True. False otherwise

static parse ( filename , skip_bonds = False ) [source] ¶

Parses a Gromacs GRO file

Parameters

filename str or file-like

Name of the file or the GRO file object

skip_bonds bool, optional

If True, skip trying to assign bonds. This can save substantial time when parsing large files with non-standard residue names. However, no bonds are assigned. This is OK if, for instance, the GRO file is being parsed simply for its coordinates. This will also reduce the accuracy of assigned atomic numbers for typical ions. Default is False.

Returns

struct Structure

The Structure instance instantiated with just residues and atoms populated (with coordinates)

static write ( struct , dest , precision = 3 , nobox = False , combine = False ) [source] ¶

Write a Gromacs Topology File from a Structure

Parameters

struct Structure

The structure to write to a Gromacs GRO file (must have coordinates)

dest str or file-like

The name of a file or a file object to write the Gromacs topology to

precision int, optional

The number of decimal places to print in the coordinates. Default 3

nobox bool, optional

If the system does not have a periodic box defined, and this option is True, no box will be written. If False, the periodic box will be defined to enclose the solute with 0.5 nm clearance on all sides. If periodic box dimensions are defined, this variable has no effect.

combine ‘all’, None, or list of iterables, optional

Equivalent to the combine argument of the GromacsTopologyFile.write method. If None, system atom order may be changed to meet the need for contiguously bonded groups of atoms to be part of a single moleculetype. All other values leave the atom order unchanged. Default is None.

class parmed.gromacs. GromacsTopologyFile ( fname = None , defines = None , parametrize = True , xyz = None , box = None ) [source] ¶

Bases: parmed.structure.Structure

Class providing a parser and writer for a GROMACS topology file

Parameters

fname str

The name of the file to read

defines list of str=None

If specified, this is the set of defines to use when parsing the topology file

parametrized bool, optional

If True, parameters are assigned after parsing is done from the parametertypes sections. If False, only parameter types defined in the parameter sections themselves are loaded (i.e., on the same line as the parameter was defined). Default is True

xyz str or array, optional

The source of atomic coordinates. It can be a string containing the name of a coordinate file from which to fill the coordinates (and optionally the unit cell information), or it can be an array with the coordinates. Default is None

box array, optional

If provided, the unit cell information will be set from this variable. If provided, it must be a collection of 6 floats representing the unit cell dimensions a, b, c, alpha, beta, and gamma, respectively. Default is None.

Notes

If the xyz argument is a file name that contains the unit cell information, this unit cell information is set. However, the box argument takes precedence and will override values given in the coordinate file unless it has its default value of None .

Attributes

write ( dest , combine = None , parameters = 'inline' , molfile = None , itp = False ) [source] ¶

Write a Gromacs Topology File from a Structure

Parameters

dest str or file-like

The name of a file or a file object to write the Gromacs topology to

combine ‘all’, None, or list of iterables, optional

If None, no molecules are combined into a single moleculetype. If ‘all’, all molecules are combined into a single moleculetype. Otherwise, the list of molecule indices (start from 0) will control which atoms are combined into single moleculetype’s. Default is None

parameters ‘inline’ or str or file-like object, optional

This specifies where parameters should be printed. If ‘inline’ (default), the parameters are written on the same lines as the valence terms are defined on. Any other string is interpreted as a filename for an ITP that will be written to and then included at the top of dest . If it is a file-like object, parameters will be written there. If parameters is the same as dest , then the parameter types will be written to the same topologyfile.

molfile None or str of file-like object, optional

If specified as other than None, the molecules will be written to a separate file that is included in the main topology file. The name of this file will be the provided srting. If None or the same as the `` dest’’, the molecules will be written into the body of the topology file. If it is a file-like object, the molecules will be written there. Using this option can make it easier to combine multiple molecules into the same topology. This will change where the following topology sections are written: moleculetype, atoms, bonds, pairs, angles, dihedrals, cmap, settles, virtual_sites2, virtual_sites3 and exclusions.

itp bool, optional

If True the following topology sections are not written: defaults, atomtypes, nonbond_params, bondtypes, pairtypes, angletypes, dihedraltypes, cmaptypes, system and molecules Thus only the individual molecules will be written in a stand-alone fashion, i.e. an itp-file. If True the molfile parameter will be set to None

Raises

ValueError if the same molecule number appears in multiple combine lists

TypeError if the dest input cannot be parsed

ValueError if the combine, parameters, or molfile input cannot be parsed

Jerusalem Archaeological Excavations

The Philadelphia Church of God is excited to be participating in the work of renowned archaeologist Dr. Eilat Mazar in Jerusalem, Israel. Since 2006, in joint-participation with the Armstrong International Cultural Foundation , Herbert W. Armstrong College has sent student volunteers to aid with both the excavation process and the production of the final publication covering the dig.

Herbert W. Armstrong College faculty and students have been involved in the uncovering of such amazing discoveries as King David’s Palace, Nehemiah’s wall, and the Solomonic Wall. Two key artifacts are two clay seal impressions of two biblical figures mentioned in the book of Jeremiah, and are currently on exhibit in Armstrong Auditorium as part of a larger archaeological display.

Student volunteers participating in the excavations live in Jerusalem from two to six months and contribute on the dig daily, receiving credit toward their diploma in the process. Dr. Mazar also uses Armstrong College students to shoot and edit video, take photographs and write articles for the excavation’s blog, KeytoDavidsCity.com .

In other collaboration, the foundation has contributed to the preservation of Liberty Bell Park in Jerusalem in memory of Teddy Kollek and Herbert W. Armstrong. The late mayor of Jerusalem and Mr. Armstrong worked together to build the park, which features a replica of Philadelphia’s Liberty Bell and was dedicated on July 4, 1978. The donation is part of the college’s ongoing efforts to revive the humanitarian legacy of Herbert Armstrong and his support for Jerusalem. Under Mr. Armstrong, Ambassador College sent hundreds of students to assist Benjamin Mazar, the late grandfather of Eilat Mazar, in his Temple Mount excavations in the 1970s.

7 Reasons Why You Are Seeing 116 – The Meaning of 116

Updated on March 8, 2022 by Emma

Angel number 116 is a sign from the Ascended Masters and your guardian angels that executive achievement and spiritual abundance are on the horizon for you.

Number 116 can also be perceived as an extraordinary interpretation of angel number 8, often associated with prosperity, achievement, and abundance.

Every time number 8’s vibrational energy manifests itself through number 116, that is a clear sign of prosperity and abundance in your family life. This special number will help you attain all your material needs at the most convenient time.

If the angel number 116 keeps coming to you, there is a lot you need to learn. It is a fairly wide topic, but we have summarized all the essential bits in this post.

The numbers 1 and 6 are the two spiritual numbers that hold the true meaning behind angel number 116. We need to understand the power, spiritual energies, and secret influence that these numbers hold to understand the angel number 116 meaning and extract the messages behind it.

Number 1

Number 1 appears twice in 116, indicating that it holds a stronger influence over angel number 116 and thus bringing the energies of number 11, a powerful master number to modern esotericists.

This special number also denotes self-reliance, progress, uniqueness, and resilience. It bears the strongest vibrations of willpower and ambition.

Number 6

When you see the number 6 , you have a close affinity to family and home. Everyone around you knows you as a people person with a heart filled with care and devotion.

This makes plenty of sense since the number 6 is also considered as the mother number. It’s closely linked to the Lovers Tarot card, and its colors are purple, indigo, and green.

Number 6 appears in most angel numbers as a sign that you need to strike a balance between your family and your career. Give every aspect of your life equal levels of commitment and time.

Number 6 denotes emotional depth, truth, faith, and honesty. It’s considered a masculine angel number since, in most cases, it’s the father who has the leadership role and takes care of his family.

Number 116

There’s plenty of positivity behind the number 1 in angel number 116. It’s often associated with assertiveness, courage, fresh beginnings, and strong leadership skills.

Angel number 116 encourages all forms of manifestations and thought-provoking ideas that inspire new actions and new beginnings. It also holds a ton of significance in your love life and every other essential part of your well-being.

Forge an Admirable Legacy

The example you set for your people at home or your subordinates at work may impact their lives in ways that were beyond your wildest dreams. The things you do today will determine the kind of legacy you leave behind when your time here on earth is done.

Always be content with what you have today and find meaning in the little things. Allow your guardian angels to take care of your tomorrow and everything that comes with it.

Stay Calm and Find Rest for Your Soul

Through angel number 116, your guardian angels are announcing success in all your life endeavors. If you constantly worry about your family or career, your angels have this message for you: relax.

The only way you can find true happiness and satisfaction in this life is to let go of the negative energies and think positive thoughts. Your guardian angels will help you by extending their message of encouragement, hope, and peace.

What to Do When You See Angel Number 116?

Maintain positive thoughts, ideas, and attitudes in regard to your life and your future as well.

Endeavor to make those dreams a reality by giving your angels complete control over your plans. Surrendering is the best way to release your stress and anxiety and find the peace you need to move on in this journey of life.

Trust in your actions and be receptive to any signs your guardian angels try to put out. They’re always with you in your pursuit of success in every aspect of your life.

Never put your angel in the backseat. Always ask for their guidance and be ready to hearken to their signs and words of wisdom; they’re ready to help you with whatever issue you may be dealing with, be it at home or work.

Don’t rush your angel, too. They operate from the spiritual realm and execute their plans at their own pace.

Unlike the negative people in your life, your guardian angels are always out for your success. They can make your dreams a reality only if you’re prepared to listen to them and put in the extra effort.

Trust in your actions and be receptive to any signs your guardian angels try to put out. They’re always with you in your pursuit of success in every aspect of your life.

Never put your angel in the backseat. Always ask for their guidance and be ready to hearken to their signs and words of wisdom; they’re ready to help you with whatever issue you may be dealing with, be it at home or work.

Don’t rush your angel, too. They operate from the spiritual realm and execute their plans at their own pace.

Unlike the negative people in your life, your guardian angels are always out for your success. They can make your dreams a reality only if you’re prepared to listen to them and put in the extra effort.

Since you’re now familiar with angel number 116, here are some random bits of information about this number that you may find interesting.

116 is a composite even number and is made up of two definite prime numbers compounded together.

116 is the official fire emergency hotline in Peru.

116 is denoted as 1110100 in binary code and recorded as CXVI in Roman numerals.

On average, it would take you exactly 58 seconds to count all the way from 1 all the way down to 116. This is because 116 seconds is equivalent to a minute and 56 seconds.

The Hundred Years’ War between England and France lasted for exactly 116 years (1337 through 1453).

116 consists of 6 divisors, which all add up to 210. It has an aliquot sum of 94, which makes it a defective number.

Things at home will get better. Your business venture will be a huge success.

Whatever you place your hand upon will flourish and will be the biggest testament to your hard work and perseverance.

The 116 angel number dictates that you need to be ready to treat others the same way you would want to be treated.

You’ll equally get abundantly more than your original expectations only if you learn to give more than you receive. In the Christian faith, it’s believed to be more blessed to give than to receive.

Finally, keep in mind that being a successful person doesn’t come easy. Have a clear work schedule, put your heart in everything you do, and set aside time for your family and friends.

AIDA: The 4-Step Copywriting Formula for More Persuasive Emails

Vero

How would you like to write persuasive emails that hit it out of the ballpark each and every time?

You’ll increase your chances of success if you follow a century-old formula that marketers and salespeople have been using since the 1900s. I learned it in university 20+ years ago, and it’s still being taught and applied today. It’s been used for various selling situations, from face-to-face sales presentations to printed sales letters, and now, social media.

That’s how good it is.

In this post, I’m going to show you what this formula is, and how to apply it when writing persuasive emails.

The AIDA Copywriting Formula

AIDA stands for:

A ttention

I nterest

D esire

A ction

These words show the natural progression of an encounter with a prospect that would lead to a sale.

In the case of email marketing, this is the progression from the time your subscribers see your email to the time they click on the link in your email:

Attention

Nothing will happen unless you first catch your subscribers’ attention.

Emails that don’t catch attention are deleted without being read. Two parts of your email can catch your subscribers’ attention. The first is the sender’s name. A generic sender, such as “Info,” “Support” or, worse, “No Reply,” won’t get attention. The email may even be perceived as spam.

However, a friendly sender, such as a specific person’s name , is more likely to get attention. Unless you are a household name and have an excellent reputation — like Amazon, Zappos or Apple — indicating a specific person as the sender is a good idea.

Another way to have an attention-getting sender name is to use special characters . For example:

~ Chris from Vero ~

Don’t go crazy with the special characters, though, or your email will look like it came from a tweener.

The other part of your email that should get the readers’ attention is, of course, the email subject line.

As we’ve discussed in detail in a previous post , effective subject lines:

Contain trigger words like “free delivery,” “sale” and “news”

Personalize by using the recipients’ names

Are either very short or very long

Connect with the readers’ internal issues, or an external event

However, this is not the only job of your subject line. Aside from grabbing attention, the subject line also needs to pique . . .

Interest

The second step in writing persuasive emails is “interest.” In a sales presentation, after getting the attention of the prospect, you need to get him or her to listen to you.

Similarly, in an email, it’s not enough to get attention. Just because you have your subscribers’ attention doesn’t mean they will actually read your email. You have to interest them enough to get them to open your email and read it.

In an email, this is the job of your subject line and the email’s lead or first few paragraphs.

Here are three ways to write persuasive emails:

Talk about a problem your readers care about. Write about something that keeps them up at night, a problem they desperately want a solution for, and they’ll be interested in what you have to say.

Tell a story. Humans are hardwired to listen to stories. We’re interested in what happens to other people, and we tend to identify with characters in stories. We may even have the same emotional responses. Stories are powerful.

Make a big promise. Another way to make your readers look and read is to make a big, bold statement. Doing this makes them lean in and mentally ask, “Really? How?” Of course, your promise needs to be big enough to be interesting but believable enough to be taken seriously.

Desire

Now your subscribers are reading your email. Your next task is to build a burning desire for your offer, whether it’s free information or a product for sale. Without this desire, your readers will discontinue reading, or read without clicking, and then delete or ignore your email.

Sometimes you have to fight apathy. Your readers may recognize a problem and want a solution for it, but not enough to actually do something about it. They’re too lazy or busy or preoccupied.

So in the main body of your persuasive email, you have to make your readers want your offer badly enough to overcome those obstacles.

How do you do this? You have several options:

Show the features and the benefits. Did you know that people make buying decisions based on emotion but need to rationalize those decisions with facts? So give your reader emotion and facts to make them feel good about wanting your offer.Give them the facts — the objective, observable characteristics of your offer.But arouse their emotions by going beyond features and pointing out the benefits. These refer to changes in your readers’ condition that occur as a result of consuming your offer. For example, a free report may give them the information to do something with confidence, earn the admiration of their colleagues and feel smart.The best way to identify the benefit of a feature or a set of features is to ask, “So what?” So you have a free report about email best practices – so what? Keep asking until you’ve uncovered the deepest results your readers want.

Prove it. If you made a big, bold promise or statement, then you have to prove it. Before-and-after photos are powerful proof elements. You can also cite specific results from customers or promise to show a video demonstration. You could also paint a vivid picture of life with your product to whet your readers’ appetite.

Use social proof. No matter how independent-minded we think we are, we all tend to do what others are doing. This is called “social proof.” An example of social proof is telling readers that 13,489 people have already downloaded your free report. Testimonials are another form of social proof. Make sure the individuals giving the testimonials are as similar to your readers as possible.

Make it scarce. The fear of missing out on something increases our desire for it. On the other hand, when something is plentiful and readily available, we tend to take it for granted. This is the basis for using scarcity in sales and marketing. To add scarcity to your offer, make it available for a limited time only. Or, if it’s for a physical product, say that the number of items is limited. Whatever you do, don’t manufacture scarcity. Always tell the truth.

Now your reader rabidly wants your offer. Your job isn’t done. Many readers get to this point and then delete the email. Don’t let this happen with your readers!

Action

The copywriting formula culminates with you telling your readers what to do next. This step is also known as the “call to action,” or CTA. In an email, your call to action can be in the form of words, a button, or both.

The ultimate goal of your email is to get the click, so tell your readers to do just that: Tell them to click! Don’t assume they know this or will figure it out. Spell it out for them.

As this post explains , there are four research-backed ways to make effective email CTAs:

Lower the cost of clicking. Make a high-value offer while keeping the cost of clicking to a minimum.

Place your call to action at the bottom of your email . The next best location is on the left side of the email.

Use arrows and graphic elements to emphasize your call-to-action button.

Consider putting multiple CTAs throughout your email. The P.S. of your email, for example, is another good place to have your CTA.

It’s important to think of the formula as a series of steps because if you try to circumvent the process, you will most likely fail.

On the other hand, if you gently lead your readers along, step by step, you’ll be more likely to succeed.

Next time you sit down to write an email, think “AIDA.” Soon, it will become second nature, and you’ll be able to write persuasive emails well.

Talk About a Tight Fit: Mechanical Adjustments Crucial in CMOD Install of Air Handlers at Salk Hall

Posted on 10/13/2021

Talk About a Tight Fit: Mechanical Adjustments Crucial in CMOD Install of Air Handlers at Salk Hall

LGH recently worked with Ruthrauff Sauer in Pittsburgh, assisting on a renovation of Jonas Salk Hall at the University of Pittsburgh, the home of the School of Pharmacy and the School of Dental Medicine. Bob Snyder was the foreman on site, responsible for procuring the crane picks and equipment to be used. LGH rental representative Pat McPherson worked alongside Bob and his team, going through the project’s drawings and working to come up with the best possible solution.

Ruthrauff was called upon to set four assembled air handler units in various final locations around the building. In total, there were nearly 40 large sections and numerous smaller parts needing to be set in place over the course of three weeks.

None of the sections had a known center of gravity and each piece had different weights and dimensions. With four pick points per side, the use of a single spreader beam was not a possibility, and a 3-beam setup would have cost additional headroom along with added rigging weight. To counter that issue, LGH supplied a Modulift CMOD (corner modular spreader beam) unit with four pick points in total, allowing all eight lifting lugs to be engaged at the same time without the additional rigging.

Along with the CMOD setup, additional struts were included to allow for custom sizing to fit each individual section. To ensure each pick would remain level, four 12-ton sheave blocks were used below the beam along with four 5-ton hand chain hoists that were paired with 30-foot-long wire rope.

Utilizing this setup, the team had the ability to individually adjust the load at all four corners, which was imperative given the tight space constraints of the final location.

With only two inches of clearance on either side of the unit, there was minimal margin for error and the use of the CMOD along with the mechanical adjustment at the pick points allowed for each pick to be consistently and reliably place each unit in place while staying within the tight windows.

As a long-time customer, Ruthroff Service trusted LGH to supply the equipment needed to complete their project on schedule.

Chicken Salad

Written By Mel

Published On April 6, 2022

Chicken Salad is a quick and easy recipe that you can use to make chicken salad sandwiches, wraps, or serve it as a spread with crackers. It’s a great way to use up leftover chicken for a light and delicious lunch or dinner.

PIN IT NOW TO SAVE FOR LATER!

One of my favorite ways to use leftover chicken is this recipe. Especially during the summer when we grill chicken – I like to cook extra just to have chicken salad sandwiches the next day.

This is a cool and creamy salad made with cooked chicken, seasonings, cheese, and a creamy mayo-sour cream dressing. It’s great all year, but we really enjoy it when it is warm, and we don’t feel like cooking.

Even if you don’t have leftover chicken, you can still make it. Just pick up some canned chicken or a rotisserie chicken at the store. They both work great.

Chicken Salad Recipe Recipe

Ingredients

Cooked shredded chicken – you can cook your own or use canned chicken or rotisserie chicken.

Mayonnaise

Sour cream

Garlic powder

Paprika

Salt and black pepper

Shredded cheddar cheese

Grated Parmesan cheese

Chopped red onion

Diced green onion

Diced celery

How to Make Chicken Salad

Place the shredded chicken in a large bowl. Add the mayo, sour cream, and all of the seasonings. Mix well to combine.

Add the rest of the ingredients and stir.

Different Ways to Serve Chicken Salad

Sandwich Recipe: Use it as a sandwich filling and serve it on sliced bread, croissants, or bagels. Add lettuce and sliced tomatoes for a delicious cold sandwich.

Wraps: It also makes excellent wraps! Roll it up in flour tortillas or use it to make lettuce wraps.

Spread: Sometimes we like to have chicken salad with crackers. Spread it on Ritz, saltines, Wheat Thins, or other sturdy crackers that you like.

Salad: Make a green salad and add a scoop of chicken salad on top.

Recipe Variations

Any cooked chicken will work for this recipe – I like chicken breasts or thighs. You can use leftover slow cooker shredded chicken, grilled chicken, or baked chicken. Another option is to use leftover roast turkey to make this salad.

Leave out the cheese or switch up the cheddar for your favorite. Monterey jack, pepper jack, Gruyere, or Provolone would all work well and blue cheese is also good if you like that flavor.

Sometimes I add cooked and crumbled bacon or bacon bits to this chicken salad recipe.

FAQ

Is this version healthy?

It really depends on the recipe and how much mayonnaise is in it. Some chicken salads are really creamy with a rich dressing, which isn’t always healthy. You can always lighten it up with low-fat mayonnaise and use lean chicken breast meat.

Can you freeze chicken salad?

If your chicken salad is made with mayonnaise, it won’t freeze well.

How long does it keep?

Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator. It will keep for three to four days.

Because it’s made with mayo, chicken salad shouldn’t be kept at room temperature for more than two hours. If it’s hot, that time should be shortened.

This chicken salad recipe is so easy to make – it’s always a favorite at our house and I hope you give it a try soon!

April 6, 2018 Storm Chase | Severe Storm along the Red River

This was another very marginal day in the early part of the storm season. In reality this was the dreaded ‘equipment test’ day. In lieu of having anything to actually shoot, I headed out to SC OK to shoot storms that were forming along the red river. We actually got to film some severe storms with half dollar size hail. The bases on these storms were low with little structure.

Upcoming Webinar on Email Deliverability and Marketing Automation

August 7, 2013

By Tom Burke

As far as marketing strategy in 2013 is concerned, email marketing is the digital king. Yes, social media and PPC have their place, but as Katie Oakes puts it, email marketing is the hub of the marketing web. Numerous studies , reports, forecasts and the like highlight the importance of email as an effective marketing tool, showing how it continues to generate the highest ROI of all marketing channels.

But simply adding email marketing to your marketing mix (or ramping up your current efforts) often isn’t enough to drive the sales you desire…and your CEO expects. To be truly effective, your emails must 1) reach your potential buyers’ inboxes and 2) engage with relevant, timely information. To accomplish these tasks, email marketers must maintain a clean email list and send highly targeted messages to the right people at the right time.

Sound difficult? It doesn’t have to be! New technology, especially email validation and marketing automation, makes it increasingly easy to get the results you expect from your email marketing.

In the upcoming webinar “ Delivering Results: Email, Automation & The New Buyer’s Journey ,” Kuno Creative CEO Chris Knipper and I will explore these ideas and more to help you take control of your email marketing success. Kuno Creative is an enterprise inbound marketing agency and HubSpot Platinum Partner focused on delivering qualified sales leads to companies.

To open the webinar, I will discuss a number of variables that can impact a sender’s email deliverability, including database issues. I’ll also provide insight into how to fix these hindrances to make sure your messages are received. My talking points include:

Bad data and how to remove it

Bounces, spam traps and active-but-abandoned email addresses

Sender IP address issues

The importance of frequent emails for maintaining a database

Data enhancement for personalization

Taking it a step further, Knipper will break down modern email marketing best practices and how to use marketing automation to its fullest potential. Expect him to cover:

Email—it’s so much more than your monthly newsletter!

Winning tactics for crafting compelling email marketing messages, including subject lines, offers, messaging, design and delivery

Data and technology utilization to personalize the experience for the New Buyer

Marketing Automation—email and beyond

“Delivering Results: Email, Automation & the New Buyer’s Journey” will take place Thursday, August 15, at 1 p.m. EST. Click here to reserve your space today!

Upcoming Webinar on Email Deliverability and Marketing Automation

As far as marketing strategy in 2013 is concerned, email marketing is the digital king. Yes, social media and PPC have their place, but as Katie Oakes puts it, email marketing is the hub of the marketing web. Numerous studies , reports, forecasts and the like highlight the importance of email as an effective marketing tool, showing how it continues to generate the highest ROI of all marketing channels.

But simply adding email marketing to your marketing mix (or ramping up your current efforts) often isn’t enough to drive the sales you desire…and your CEO expects. To be truly effective, your emails must 1) reach your potential buyers’ inboxes and 2) engage with relevant, timely information. To accomplish these tasks, email marketers must maintain a clean email list and send highly targeted messages to the right people at the right time.

Sound difficult? It doesn’t have to be! New technology, especially email validation and marketing automation, makes it increasingly easy to get the results you expect from your email marketing.

In the upcoming webinar “ Delivering Results: Email, Automation & The New Buyer’s Journey ,” Kuno Creative CEO Chris Knipper and I will explore these ideas and more to help you take control of your email marketing success. Kuno Creative is an enterprise inbound marketing agency and HubSpot Platinum Partner focused on delivering qualified sales leads to companies.

To open the webinar, I will discuss a number of variables that can impact a sender’s email deliverability, including database issues. I’ll also provide insight into how to fix these hindrances to make sure your messages are received. My talking points include:

Bad data and how to remove it

The importance of frequent emails for maintaining a database

Taking it a step further, Knipper will break down modern email marketing best practices and how to use marketing automation to its fullest potential. Expect him to cover:

Email—it’s so much more than your monthly newsletter!

Winning tactics for crafting compelling email marketing messages, including subject lines, offers, messaging, design and delivery

Data and technology utilization to personalize the experience for the New Buyer

Goal

To demonstrate the suitability of the new Thermo Scientific™ Instant Connect PTV-backflush inlet module for analytical testing laboratories wanting to increase sample throughput and improve method robustness.

Introduction

Analytical testing laboratories require the capability to analyze a large number of samples every day, for both screening and quantification of specific target analytes. However, these analytes are often present in complex matrices, such as food or fuel, that contain many other compounds that can adversely affect the routine maintenance interval, reducing the overall laboratory throughput and increasing the cost per sample. To overcome the detrimental effects of the matrix on the instrumentation during these analyses, various steps are taken, often including rigorous sample clean-up procedures like solid phase extraction (SPE). However, SPE can only reduce the matrix and some unwanted, high boiling compounds often remain in the samples. Also, for some samples, clean-up cannot be used at all, so an alternative approach to improving method robustness is required. An alternative method is to use GC column backflushing, which works by reversing the flow of carrier gas through the capillary column at a specific time point defined by the analyst, usually after the last compound of interest has eluted. However, backflush technology has historically been difficult to adopt and use as it is not always user friendly or robust, and usually requires an auxiliary gas, adding complexity to the GC configuration. This is particularly problematic for analytical testing laboratories where robustness and sample throughput are critical to business success, and where analysts are required to be able to install and use the system quickly with minimal training. Here we describe a novel backflush injection device, with a robust design, that is easy to implement and use with the Thermo Scientific™ TRACE™ 1600 Series GC.

Setup and control

The Thermo Scientific Instant Connect PTV-backflush injector module can be configured as pre-column, post-column, or mid-column backflush with the use of a Thermo Scientific microfluidic device based on SilFlow® technology, which is easily accessible, fitting neatly within the column oven. The pneumatic control is completely integrated in the PTV injector module, removing the complexity and expense of an additional auxiliary gas module, and facilitating easy method setup thanks to the self-adjusting pressure during backflushing. In the pre-column setup (Figure 1A), an injection from the inlet is made onto a pre-column, typically an empty deactivated guard column, before passing into the analytical column. In this setup, the unwanted heavier matrix remains within the pre-column, while the analytes of interest progress to the analytical column. As the backflushing is turned on and the oven temperature increases, the matrix contaminants, still in the pre-column, experience a reversal in column flow and are then backflushed through the inlet and vented through the split line. Preventing the high boilers from entering the analytical column has a twofold effect: a shorter run time, and an extended column lifetime with increased instrument uptime between maintenance operations. As an additional benefit, the PTV is heated to a higher temperature during the backflush cleaning step to further reduce the matrix contamination, leaving the inlet extra clean for the next injection. In the post-column setup (Figure 1B), an injection from the inlet is made directly onto the analytical column, before passing through the backflush microfluidic device and then into a narrow post-column restrictor leading to a detector. In this configuration, when the backflush is turned on, heavier compounds remaining in the analytical column are backflushed to the inlet and expelled again through the split line. This mode backflushes the entire analytical column and is useful for cases when there is matrix contamination across the entire boiling point range, which needs to be separated from the target analytes before backflushing. This mode is often used with mass spectrometry to protect the ion source from unnecessary contamination, further extending uptime and method robustness. An intermediate configuration is represented by the mid-column backflush, where the empty pre-column is replaced by a short piece of analytical column. This configuration makes it easier to find the right backflush time thanks to the enhanced separation in the pre-column, while allowing convenient replacement of the pre-column as regular maintenance, preserving the analytical column lifetime. The iConnect PTV-backflush module is easily controlled within the Thermo Scientific™ Chromeleon™ CDS. The timing of the backflush is configured within the instrument method settings for the PTV as part of the cleaning step. The backflush start time is determined by the transfer time in addition to the injection time and the time to reach the transfer temperature (Figure 3). The transfer time is initially adjusted experimentally, usually in 0.5 min increments, and ultimately tightened down to within 0.01 min increments, providing precise and reproducible enough cut times that will split sharp GC-grade peaks in half.

Main configurations

Post-column configuration

When set up in the post-column configuration, the analytical column is connected directly from the PTV injector to the microfluidic device, and a narrow bore restrictor is then connected from the microfluidic device to the detector. In this example, a 30 m x 0.25 mm i.d. x 0.25 µm Thermo Scientific™ TraceGOLD™ TG-1MS analytical column (P/N 26099-1420) was used, coupled to a 1 m x 0.1 mm i.d. uncoated, deactivated transfer line (P/N 60201-393) to connect to the Thermo Scientific iConnect FID. In this configuration, a clean cut at a specific retention time can be easily achieved by turning the backflush on after the last analyte of interest has eluted from the analytical column. This enables a straightforward and quick method setup, while still preventing later eluting compounds from reaching the detector, keeping it cleaner for longer. This configuration makes precise cuts during the chromatography easy and straightforward. In the example shown in Figure 5, a sample containing 50,000 ppm diesel in dichloromethane (DCM) was spiked with 100 ppm cyclohexane, toluene, and p-xylene and run with and without backflushing. The backflush was enabled at 8 min, and held for an additional 7 min, giving a 15 min run time. A clean cut is made in the chromatography at 8 min with most of the diesel backflushed off the column, avoiding the detector. Diesel and similar heavy petrochemical streams often contain unwanted high molecular weight material that not only gets pushed backwards during the backflush phase, but whose removal is also aided by the PTV’s higher temperature cleaning phase to ensure optimum cleanliness of the system.

Pre-column configuration

When set up in the pre-column configuration, a guard column is installed from the inlet to the microfluidic device, and the analytical column is connected from the microfluidic device to the detector. An uncoated, deactivated pre-column of 5 m x 0.32 mm, (P/N 26050-0532), is recommended. In this configuration, the backflush is turned on after the last analyte has entered the analytical column while the high boiling matrix stays behind in the pre-column. The reversed carrier flow in the precolumn backflushes these heavier compounds through the split line, while the analytes continue to flow forwards through the analytical column to the detector. This configuration has the advantage of protecting the analytical column as well as the detector from the high boiling matrix and removing the high boiling compounds more quickly at a lower oven temperature during the backflush stage. Figure 6 shows stacked overlaid total ion chromatograms for a mixed pesticide standard in an agricultural matrix, acquired using a Thermo Scientific™ TSQ™ 9000 GC-MS/MS system with Advanced EI (AEI) ion source, run in timed-SRM mode, using a 30 m x 0.25 mm i.d. x 0.25 µm Thermo Scientific™ TraceGOLD™ TG-5SilMS analytical column (P/N 26096-1420), with backflush turned on after 5 min and after 8 min. To further illustrate this process, consider the last eluting pesticide in this standard, which is chlorantraniliprole. If the backflush is switched on too early (5 min), this compound is not detected, (Figure 7A). If a longer time is used before the backflush is turned on (8 min), this compound is detected (Figure 7B) and any higher boiling matrix still in the pre-column will be backflushed from the system. Not only does the backflush completely prevent the heavy compounds from reaching the detector, but there is zero detectable mass even in the most sensitive, AEI-triple-quadrupole configuration. The backflush technique is rapidly being adopted in agricultural pesticide screening methods, since the adoption of faster, simpler, and more generic methods of extraction like QuEChERS, with minimal dSPE clean-up, to facilitate higher sample throughput. Despite the obvious benefits, this sample preparation approach can result in extracts with high levels of matrix co-extractives, which inevitably lead to faster contamination of the GC-MS system. Hence, an efficient backflush is helpful to prevent contamination and extend system uptime with these challenging samples. Additionally, an orange matrix was spiked with a pesticide mix and tested by using n=100 repeated injections with the backflush enabled and a similar number of injections with the backflush disabled. The inlet liner (Thermo Scientific™ LinerGOLD™, six baffled, P/N 453T2845-UI), septum, and chromatographic capillary column (TraceGOLD TG-5SilMS, P/N 26096-1420) were changed between the two sequences. Ion source cleaning and mass spectrometer tuning (Thermo Scientific™ ISQ™ 7000 GC-MS equipped with a Thermo Scientific™ ExtractaBrite™ ion source) were performed for each experiment. Orange is a complex matrix containing sugars, oils, terpenoids, and acids (mainly citric acid) that elute along the chromatogram, affecting both the chromatographic performance and interfering with the target analytes (pesticides), thereby leading to loss of quantitative precision (Figure 8). The peak areas of targeted pesticides obtained from the two experiments were compared using a t-test, and the p-value (probability indicating significance level) was calculated. The p-value was <0.05, therefore representing a statistically significant difference between the results as reported in Figure 9. As an example, EIC for a mid-eluting compound (triallate) at different stages of the two sequences are reported together with the corresponding retention time deviation (relative to the initial retention time in the first injection) and peak asymmetry factor annotated (Figure 10). The comparison shows not only an improved RSD% and RT deviation when backflush is used, but a consistent response is maintained even after a hundred injections.

Assessment of analytical performance, PTV-backflush-GC-FID

One question that many people have before switching to backflush technology is whether performance parameters, such as retention time stability, repeatability of response, linearity, accuracy, and precision, will be affected as compared with non-backflush techniques. These parameters were tested using the post-column backflush configuration to ensure the integrity of results.

Retention time and peak area stability

Retention time and peak area stability were assessed by performing n=40 injections of a mixed alkanes standard using the iConnect PTV-Backflush and calculating the standard deviation of the retention time (SD RT) and the %RSD of the peak area. Table 1 shows the results for six compounds at 1 ppm in hexane using the iConnect FID for detection, indicating the iConnect PTV-Backflush remains consistent over longer injection sequences.

Linearity

To assess linearity, precision, and accuracy when PTV-backflush is enabled, a sample containing 50,000 ppm v/v diesel was spiked with cyclohexane, toluene, and p-xylene across the range 0–95 ppm v/v. Precision and accuracy were assessed in a sample spiked at 50 ppm v/v. The results of these tests with the backflush enabled at 8 min, are described below. To obtain accurate quantification, a calibration curve is essential. Linearity was assessed by performing injections in duplicate across the range 0–95 ppm v/v for each of the three analytes. Excellent linearity was achieved across the range with R2 values >0.999 and average calibration factor (AvCF) %RSDs <3.

Accuracy and precision

Precision and accuracy were assessed using n=20 injections of a 50 ppm v/v standard. An overlay of the chromatograms obtained is shown in Figure 12 along with the precision and accuracy values. The consistency of the results shows that there is no contribution from carryover of heavy diesel compounds, indicating that these compounds have been completely removed from the system by backflushing.

Summary

Backflushing is a valuable technique to prevent high boiling matrix compounds entering the analytical column and the detector, ensuring a more robust and reliable method, while reducing the run time, especially in the pre-column backflush configuration. This has several advantages over non-backflush methods. Utilizing backflush technology can help analytical testing laboratories dealing with difficult sample matrix to extend instrument uptime by reducing the required frequency of system maintenance. This can increase laboratory throughput and decrease running costs, all of which increase the laboratory’s return on investment. In summary, the iConnect PTV-backflush module offers: • Integrated pneumatic control for an easy and self-adjusted pressure during backflush without the need for an additional auxiliary gas channel. • The modular design of the TRACE 1600 Series GC offers the capability for the user to install the iConnect PTV-backflush module quickly and easily, at any time, without the need for a field service engineer. • The use of the microfluidic connector based on SilFlow technology allows for simplified operation in either a pre-, post-, or mid- column configuration depending on the analysis needs. • The pre-column backflush configuration assures the highest degree of robustness and sample throughput, preventing higher boiling matrix from entering the analytical column, greatly reducing the backflush time and therefore the overall analysis time. • In the case of matrix compounds covering a wide volatility range, the post-column backflush configuration facilitates the setting of the backflush timing based on the separation achieved by the analytical column. This configuration effectively backflushes the matrix compounds from the analytical column, preventing possible detector contamination, reducing maintenance, and extending instrument uptime.

To overcome the detrimental effects of the matrix on the instrumentation during these analyses, various steps are taken, often including rigorous sample clean-up procedures like solid phase extraction (SPE). However, SPE can only reduce the matrix and some unwanted, high boiling compounds often remain in the samples. Also, for some samples, clean-up cannot be used at all, so an alternative approach to improving method robustness is required. An alternative method is to use GC column backflushing, which works by reversing the flow of carrier gas through the capillary column at a specific time point defined by the analyst, usually after the last compound of interest has eluted. However, backflush technology has historically been difficult to adopt and use as it is not always user friendly or robust, and usually requires an auxiliary gas, adding complexity to the GC configuration. This is particularly problematic for analytical testing laboratories where robustness and sample throughput are critical to business success, and where analysts are required to be able to install and use the system quickly with minimal training. Here we describe a novel backflush injection device, with a robust design, that is easy to implement and use with the Thermo Scientific™ TRACE™ 1600 Series GC.

The Thermo Scientific Instant Connect PTV-backflush injector module can be configured as pre-column, post-column, or mid-column backflush with the use of a Thermo Scientific microfluidic device based on SilFlow® technology, which is easily accessible, fitting neatly within the column oven. The pneumatic control is completely integrated in the PTV injector module, removing the complexity and expense of an additional auxiliary gas module, and facilitating easy method setup thanks to the self-adjusting pressure during backflushing. In the pre-column setup (Figure 1A), an injection from the inlet is made onto a pre-column, typically an empty deactivated guard column, before passing into the analytical column. In this setup, the unwanted heavier matrix remains within the pre-column, while the analytes of interest progress to the analytical column. As the backflushing is turned on and the oven temperature increases, the matrix contaminants, still in the pre-column, experience a reversal in column flow and are then backflushed through the inlet and vented through the split line. Preventing the high boilers from entering the analytical column has a twofold effect: a shorter run time, and an extended column lifetime with increased instrument uptime between maintenance operations. As an additional benefit, the PTV is heated to a higher temperature during the backflush cleaning step to further reduce the matrix contamination, leaving the inlet extra clean for the next injection. In the post-column setup (Figure 1B), an injection from the inlet is made directly onto the analytical column, before passing through the backflush microfluidic device and then into a narrow post-column restrictor leading to a detector. In this configuration, when the backflush is turned on, heavier compounds remaining in the analytical column are backflushed to the inlet and expelled again through the split line. This mode backflushes the entire analytical column and is useful for cases when there is matrix contamination across the entire boiling point range, which needs to be separated from the target analytes before backflushing. This mode is often used with mass spectrometry to protect the ion source from unnecessary contamination, further extending uptime and method robustness. An intermediate configuration is represented by the mid-column backflush, where the empty pre-column is replaced by a short piece of analytical column. This configuration makes it easier to find the right backflush time thanks to the enhanced separation in the pre-column, while allowing convenient replacement of the pre-column as regular maintenance, preserving the analytical column lifetime. The iConnect PTV-backflush module is easily controlled within the Thermo Scientific™ Chromeleon™ CDS. The timing of the backflush is configured within the instrument method settings for the PTV as part of the cleaning step. The backflush start time is determined by the transfer time in addition to the injection time and the time to reach the transfer temperature (Figure 3). The transfer time is initially adjusted experimentally, usually in 0.5 min increments, and ultimately tightened down to within 0.01 min increments, providing precise and reproducible enough cut times that will split sharp GC-grade peaks in half.

When set up in the post-column configuration, the analytical column is connected directly from the PTV injector to the microfluidic device, and a narrow bore restrictor is then connected from the microfluidic device to the detector. In this example, a 30 m x 0.25 mm i.d. x 0.25 µm Thermo Scientific™ TraceGOLD™ TG-1MS analytical column (P/N 26099-1420) was used, coupled to a 1 m x 0.1 mm i.d. uncoated, deactivated transfer line (P/N 60201-393) to connect to the Thermo Scientific iConnect FID. In this configuration, a clean cut at a specific retention time can be easily achieved by turning the backflush on after the last analyte of interest has eluted from the analytical column. This enables a straightforward and quick method setup, while still preventing later eluting compounds from reaching the detector, keeping it cleaner for longer. This configuration makes precise cuts during the chromatography easy and straightforward. In the example shown in Figure 5, a sample containing 50,000 ppm diesel in dichloromethane (DCM) was spiked with 100 ppm cyclohexane, toluene, and p-xylene and run with and without backflushing. The backflush was enabled at 8 min, and held for an additional 7 min, giving a 15 min run time. A clean cut is made in the chromatography at 8 min with most of the diesel backflushed off the column, avoiding the detector. Diesel and similar heavy petrochemical streams often contain unwanted high molecular weight material that not only gets pushed backwards during the backflush phase, but whose removal is also aided by the PTV’s higher temperature cleaning phase to ensure optimum cleanliness of the system.

When set up in the pre-column configuration, a guard column is installed from the inlet to the microfluidic device, and the analytical column is connected from the microfluidic device to the detector. An uncoated, deactivated pre-column of 5 m x 0.32 mm, (P/N 26050-0532), is recommended. In this configuration, the backflush is turned on after the last analyte has entered the analytical column while the high boiling matrix stays behind in the pre-column. The reversed carrier flow in the precolumn backflushes these heavier compounds through the split line, while the analytes continue to flow forwards through the analytical column to the detector. This configuration has the advantage of protecting the analytical column as well as the detector from the high boiling matrix and removing the high boiling compounds more quickly at a lower oven temperature during the backflush stage. Figure 6 shows stacked overlaid total ion chromatograms for a mixed pesticide standard in an agricultural matrix, acquired using a Thermo Scientific™ TSQ™ 9000 GC-MS/MS system with Advanced EI (AEI) ion source, run in timed-SRM mode, using a 30 m x 0.25 mm i.d. x 0.25 µm Thermo Scientific™ TraceGOLD™ TG-5SilMS analytical column (P/N 26096-1420), with backflush turned on after 5 min and after 8 min. To further illustrate this process, consider the last eluting pesticide in this standard, which is chlorantraniliprole. If the backflush is switched on too early (5 min), this compound is not detected, (Figure 7A). If a longer time is used before the backflush is turned on (8 min), this compound is detected (Figure 7B) and any higher boiling matrix still in the pre-column will be backflushed from the system. Not only does the backflush completely prevent the heavy compounds from reaching the detector, but there is zero detectable mass even in the most sensitive, AEI-triple-quadrupole configuration. The backflush technique is rapidly being adopted in agricultural pesticide screening methods, since the adoption of faster, simpler, and more generic methods of extraction like QuEChERS, with minimal dSPE clean-up, to facilitate higher sample throughput. Despite the obvious benefits, this sample preparation approach can result in extracts with high levels of matrix co-extractives, which inevitably lead to faster contamination of the GC-MS system. Hence, an efficient backflush is helpful to prevent contamination and extend system uptime with these challenging samples. Additionally, an orange matrix was spiked with a pesticide mix and tested by using n=100 repeated injections with the backflush enabled and a similar number of injections with the backflush disabled. The inlet liner (Thermo Scientific™ LinerGOLD™, six baffled, P/N 453T2845-UI), septum, and chromatographic capillary column (TraceGOLD TG-5SilMS, P/N 26096-1420) were changed between the two sequences. Ion source cleaning and mass spectrometer tuning (Thermo Scientific™ ISQ™ 7000 GC-MS equipped with a Thermo Scientific™ ExtractaBrite™ ion source) were performed for each experiment. Orange is a complex matrix containing sugars, oils, terpenoids, and acids (mainly citric acid) that elute along the chromatogram, affecting both the chromatographic performance and interfering with the target analytes (pesticides), thereby leading to loss of quantitative precision (Figure 8). The peak areas of targeted pesticides obtained from the two experiments were compared using a t-test, and the p-value (probability indicating significance level) was calculated. The p-value was <0.05, therefore representing a statistically significant difference between the results as reported in Figure 9. As an example, EIC for a mid-eluting compound (triallate) at different stages of the two sequences are reported together with the corresponding retention time deviation (relative to the initial retention time in the first injection) and peak asymmetry factor annotated (Figure 10). The comparison shows not only an improved RSD% and RT deviation when backflush is used, but a consistent response is maintained even after a hundred injections.

One question that many people have before switching to backflush technology is whether performance parameters, such as retention time stability, repeatability of response, linearity, accuracy, and precision, will be affected as compared with non-backflush techniques. These parameters were tested using the post-column backflush configuration to ensure the integrity of results.

Retention time and peak area stability were assessed by performing n=40 injections of a mixed alkanes standard using the iConnect PTV-Backflush and calculating the standard deviation of the retention time (SD RT) and the %RSD of the peak area. Table 1 shows the results for six compounds at 1 ppm in hexane using the iConnect FID for detection, indicating the iConnect PTV-Backflush remains consistent over longer injection sequences.

To assess linearity, precision, and accuracy when PTV-backflush is enabled, a sample containing 50,000 ppm v/v diesel was spiked with cyclohexane, toluene, and p-xylene across the range 0–95 ppm v/v. Precision and accuracy were assessed in a sample spiked at 50 ppm v/v. The results of these tests with the backflush enabled at 8 min, are described below. To obtain accurate quantification, a calibration curve is essential. Linearity was assessed by performing injections in duplicate across the range 0–95 ppm v/v for each of the three analytes. Excellent linearity was achieved across the range with R2 values >0.999 and average calibration factor (AvCF) %RSDs <3.

Precision and accuracy were assessed using n=20 injections of a 50 ppm v/v standard. An overlay of the chromatograms obtained is shown in Figure 12 along with the precision and accuracy values. The consistency of the results shows that there is no contribution from carryover of heavy diesel compounds, indicating that these compounds have been completely removed from the system by backflushing.

Backflushing is a valuable technique to prevent high boiling matrix compounds entering the analytical column and the detector, ensuring a more robust and reliable method, while reducing the run time, especially in the pre-column backflush configuration. This has several advantages over non-backflush methods. Utilizing backflush technology can help analytical testing laboratories dealing with difficult sample matrix to extend instrument uptime by reducing the required frequency of system maintenance. This can increase laboratory throughput and decrease running costs, all of which increase the laboratory’s return on investment. In summary, the iConnect PTV-backflush module offers: • Integrated pneumatic control for an easy and self-adjusted pressure during backflush without the need for an additional auxiliary gas channel. • The modular design of the TRACE 1600 Series GC offers the capability for the user to install the iConnect PTV-backflush module quickly and easily, at any time, without the need for a field service engineer. • The use of the microfluidic connector based on SilFlow technology allows for simplified operation in either a pre-, post-, or mid- column configuration depending on the analysis needs. • The pre-column backflush configuration assures the highest degree of robustness and sample throughput, preventing higher boiling matrix from entering the analytical column, greatly reducing the backflush time and therefore the overall analysis time. • In the case of matrix compounds covering a wide volatility range, the post-column backflush configuration facilitates the setting of the backflush timing based on the separation achieved by the analytical column. This configuration effectively backflushes the matrix compounds from the analytical column, preventing possible detector contamination, reducing maintenance, and extending instrument uptime.

Products

Below are some common questions about our products

Please understand all pins are handmade and some degree of flaws are inevitable.

A: near perfect, flaws should not be on the face. If you need to use your camera to zoom into a flaw, it might not be considered a B grade. Specks of glitter or slight unevenness of pearl/sandblast effects may be present.

B: More obvious flaws that can't really be seen from arm's length. Faint scratches or pits may be present but should not take away from the general quality.

C: Very obvious flaws that can be seen arm's length. Missing enamel, wrong colours, deep scratches etc.

Thank you for liking our products. Most of our shop is Limited Edition so unfortunately we do not hold restocks. Please consider tagging me in your ISOs on IG and hopefully you can work out a trade/resale!

A Lesson In Success and Personal Responsibility From Steve Harvey

Posted on December 26, 2015

The Miss Universe debacle that Steve Harvey recently found himself the center of, has made for great entertainment on the web. Not since Kim Kardashian’s break the internet thing, have we seen so many hilarious memes about one person in such a short amount of time.

This week, my newsfeed was flooded with “ Happy Easter ” and “The look when you win after all” memes. Apparently Steve misread the card and announced second place as the winner of the competition. I mean, why do they call it “first runner up” anyway? Just call it “second place” I’d be confused too.

That’s not my point though

Despite what happened and having a mad Colombian woman who wants him dead, Steve Harvey has handled himself with an extreme amount of dignity. Even when it happened, live on TV, he immediately took responsibility and said “It’s my fault, I read it wrong, it’s right there on the card. I’m sorry. I’t s my fault”

In today’s times, this is rare. It’s rare for anyone, let alone a powerful celebrity, to admit they were wrong and take responsibility for their actions. Had this been pretty much anyone else, they would have pointed the blame on the card writer and got him fired, so they could spare their rep. Not Steve, he immediately owned up and said “sorry”

If you make a mistake, own it

Steve Harvey is a good example of a confident man. He’s been one of the hardest working men in entertainment for years. Hosting multiple TV shows, daily radio shows as well as events like Miss Universe. He’s been working his @ss off mistake free for 3 decades now. He knew that this was his fault and he also was confident enough in his track record to take responsibility and move on.

I’ve been a fan of Steve’s since the Kings of Comedy tour. Matter of fact, we both lived in the same neighborhood at one point. (Willow Bend in Plano, Texas) He’s on 105.7 here every morning and Family Feud at lunch. It’s kinda hard to miss him. The fact that he carries himself the way he does, says what he does and has managed to stay scandal free for so long, says a lot about his character in real life. Then, the one time he is caught in “scandal” he owns up to it and makes it right.

What’s even better, is that Steve Harvey has a multi-year contract with Miss Universe to host it. He’ll be right back in the same place hosting the same event next year. He’s not fired. Top producers who take personal responsibility never get fired. Hollywood probably loves Steve, compared to some of the other whiney crybabies out there.

Top producers who take personal responsibility don’t get fired

Taking personal responsibility and owning up to the mistake you have made is a a sign of strong leadership skills. In a time where most people are sheep, showing that you have the confidence to move past your mistakes, is a quality that surely stands out. It takes a mentally tough individual to have the confidence enough to make a mistake, own it, and move past it quickly.

To top it all off, yesterday, on Christmas Day, Steve Harvey posted a picture of himself on social media with the caption “ Merry Easter ” even further proving he can A: Take a joke and B: Own up to his mistake and move on. It was probably the most shared picture on social media yesterday.

The best part: Steve Harvey has been the #1 trending topic twice in one week.

PT Barnum said “any publicity is good publicity” and I know Steve is enjoying the rising of his stock, even after making what should have been a HUGE, career detouring, mistake. Take a lesson from one of the greats. If you make a mistake, own it, remedy it and move on from it. Taking responsibility and learning from the mistake will only make you that much better. I guarantee Steve double reads any cue cards before he speaks in the future. Lesson learned. Problem solved.

I’ve taken personal responsibility for my mistakes too. I’ve even put them in a book and shared the lessons from them with the world. It’s increased my stock too. Most people can’t own up for their mistakes, and when the world sees someone who can, they appreciate the authenticity.

If you’re looking for the right information so that you can make 2016 your best year ever, you’re in the right place. Fill out my form below if you’re ready to invest in yourself and take massive action with your business. Don’t waste my time though. If you’re not ready to invest, don’t fill out the form. I need to make room for the action takers first.

Majority of adults believe that regulated advice is for the wealthy

FSCS finds that Brits opt for online financial advice despite risks

Ayesha Venkataraman

31 January 2023 • 2 min read

Over half (55%) of adults in the UK believe that paying for regulated financial advice is for the wealthy, according to new research by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS).

The research, published today (31 January), reveals that almost two-thirds (64%) of UK adults with savings, investments or a mortgage have not sought regulated financial advice in the last five years. Amongst those, more than one in five of those who obtained free guidance rather than regulated advice said they did so because they believed the service was ""too expensive"". Young people aged between 18 and 34 were most likely to agree that it should be easy to invest without needing professional financial advice, it found. More than half of Millennials (60%) and Generation Z (57%) with ...

What I’ve learned about Peas

As you can see, the Peas are in full swing. I have learned some useful things about peas this year that I want to share with you. Firstly, I grew two varieties, Kelvedon Wonder (my usual) and Rondo (a new variety for me). Early on in the year I sowed both seed separately in lengths of guttering in the coldframe. Then once it got a bit warmer I put the guttering peas out and started to sow peas directly into the ground. I alternated between Kelvedon and Rondo so that I would have a successional crop of both varieties.

This sounds nice and neat on paper but in reality it didn’t work out so well. This was for several reasons. The first was that the two varieties germinated and grew at different rates. So even though I sowed them at different times, the Rondo seeds seemed to catch up on the Kelvedon pretty quick. Secondly, Kelvedon is a very short, squat variety that produces short(ish) pods with big fat peas inside. Rondo is a tall variety (1.5 metres at least) that produces larger pods with the peas spaced out inside. However, the pea sticks that I put in were really not designed to support a pea that tall and eventually the Rondo peas started to flop over – putting them at risk of slug attack and also they started to shade my carrots (which incidentally I planted way too close to my peas).

So now both varieties are pumping out at the same time and I have more peas than I can eat. So I’m busy harvesting peas everyday and freezing them until I can use the. I’m also stuffing as many into my mouth on a daily basis too – don’t want to miss out on that fresh, green taste.

So what I’ve learned is that if I grow two varieties then they should be grown in separate beds with appropriate support. And maybe choose some more distinct early and late varieties.

matt July 5, 2008

I did the same thing with cherry tomatoes one time, i calculated ripening times wrong and ended up with three varieties of cherry tomatoes at the same time- there is only so much tomato salad a person can eat :P and only so many times you can give the neighbours tomatos without them running away every time they see you approach with a ruby filled plastic bag :P

Ben July 5, 2008

Peas are a delight to grow! It is interesting to hear about your experiences with the different varieties maturing at different times. I have only grown peas that climb high up a support structure of some kind, so have placed them away from veggies that require lots of sun (I make up for the nitrogen with green manure crops).

My Grandmother never minded if we ate peas off the bushes (as many as we wanted) as long as we never ate from the bowl that she had shelled for eating! (then we were in trouble!)

I hope next year proves to be a better crop!

Karin July 5, 2008

You’re continually learning when you garden, which helps to make it interesting, if a little frustrating. Our pea pods have justed started to set, so we are hopeful.

Lauren July 6, 2008

Are you shelling-blanching-freezing? or freezing whole? or some other thing? I have a shelling variety and a sugar snap variety, and am likely to have too many of both.

Suegee July 6, 2008

You mentioned carrots! I don’t know what happened to ours but I am now on the third sowing. Nothing germinated yet last year we had a good crop. I despair since carrots fresh from the ground are such a great joy and my grandchildren love them with all their lovely ‘feathers’ on top. Hope your little jackson has some doting grandparents around

penny July 6, 2008

Pea Moth,

So what I have learnt is not to ignore advice about netting and pea moth. Brought hom ebountiful crop today only to have to throw away 2/3rds. The only thing is though I hate it that all the plot is ending up netted and even in blcak it looks ugly. Off now to pick cut flowers before they go to seed. Some lovely Malope trifida filling the sitting room. Regards Penny

Matron July 7, 2008

You make an interesting and valid point. I have the same with my broad beans this year, one older traditional variety and a new one for this year. A good idea to have an early variety and a late variety for a longer growing season and no glut.

Karin July 8, 2008

Good idea, Matron. I always use Aqua Dulce and try and sow my braod bean seed in November or January, to avoid blackfly, but I’m finding the pods aren’t always full, presumably because they’re in flowerbefore there are too many bees about. I don’t entirely avoid blackfly this way, anyway.

Maybe I should try a late variety as well and be vigilant for blackfly.

Gemma July 10, 2008

Hello mtp,

I enjoy growing vegetables in two little beds in my back garden and am on the list for an allotment (I was number 64, I have now risen to twentysomething, there is hope that I may get one oneday!) I recently discovered your site and am reading through past posts a bit every day (I am in January 06 now). Anyway, my point. It is my birthday on Monday and I hope to get a gardening magazine subscription, you post sometimes about things you’ve seen in magazines (and things you’ve written!) so I was wondering which one you would suggest I got. I mainly like veg, fruit and salad and don’t grow many ornamental things.

Hope you can help me out! Keep up the good work,

Gemma

Karin July 10, 2008

Hello, Gemma, I hope you don’t mind me telling you about gardening magazines I find useful. If you want something that tells you how to grow food, I’d recommend Kitchen Garden magazine http://www.kitchengarden.co.uk/ , which I bought for several years. If like me, you are interested in growing food with the environment in mind, then try the Organic Gardening Magazine http://www.organicgardeningmagazine.co.uk/

My local W H Smith stocks a reasonable supply of these each month. I don’t know about other newsagents as I live in a one newsagent town.

I think good, easy to understand but well-informed gardening books are the best, but you need to make time to sit down and study them. The book that accompanied Carol Klein’s tv programme, ‘Grow Your own Veg’ is colourful and easy to read, but also has lots of info and good advice, so that could be a good one to start with.

Gemma July 18, 2008

Thank you Karin,

I will certainly check out the two magazines that you suggested. I have Carol Klein’s book at home, it really is a nice one isn’t it?

I haven’t read either of the magazines that you suggested before – so thank you! I have occasionally read Gardener’s World which seems to have a bit too much of everything else and not enough fruit and veg. I bought Grow Your Own once which is definitely the right ethos for me but I was distracted by quite a lot of trivial mistakes in it (spelling and formatting). Maybe it has got better now though!

Thank you!

Gemma

Privacy Policy

Introduction

My Swing Evolution LLC is committed to protecting our customer privacy and takes its responsibility regarding the security of customer information and data very seriously. We will be clear and transparent about the information we are collecting and what we will do with that information or data.

This Policy sets out the following:

What personal data we collect and process about you in connection with your relationship with us as a customer and through your use of our website, apps, mobile applications, and online services;

Where we obtain the data from;

What we do with that data;

How we store the data;

The persons to which we transfer or disclose personal data;

How we deal with your data protection rights;

How we comply with the data protection rules.

That personal data is collected and processed in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

Data Controller

“My Swing Evolution LLC” (referred to as “we”, “us”, “our” or “My Swing Evolution LLC”) in this policy primarily refers to My Swing Evolution LLC, the main operating company of the My Swing Evolution LLC, and, where appropriate, to other companies in the My Swing Evolution LLC or other entities over which My Swing Evolution LLC exercises management control. My Swing Evolution LLC is the “data controller” of all personal data that is collected and used about My Swing Evolution LLC customers for the purposes of privacy and data protection laws, principles and regulations which may apply in your country.

What personal data we collect

Personal data means any information relating to you which allows us to identify you, such as your name, phone number, social media name or ‘handle’, postal address, email address, details of products or services you have purchased, payment details and information about your access to our website.

We may collect personal data from you (either directly or indirectly, through our third-party partners or providers) in a number of ways.

Specifically, we may collect the following categories of personal data:

Name, home address, e-mail address, telephone number, credit/debit card or other payment details;

Information such as nationality, place, and date of birth, and gender;

Medical conditions or requirements, and dietary preferences;

Information you provide about yourself and any preferences in your account;

Information about your purchases of products and services from us or our partners;

Information about your use of our website or app;

Communications with us or directed to us via letters, emails, chat services, calls, and social media; and

Location, including real-time geographic location of your computer or device through GPS, Bluetooth and your IP address, along with crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspot and cell-tower locations, but only if you use location-based features and turn on the location services settings on your device or computer.

Personal details including about your physical or mental health are considered “sensitive” personal data under applicable data protection laws. We will process any such data only if you have given your explicit consent, or it is necessary (for instance if you request special assistance), or you have deliberately made it public.

What do we use your personal data for, why, and for how long

Your data may be used for the following purposes:

Provide products and services you request: we use the information you give us to perform the services for which you have signed up;

Credit or other payment card verification/screening; and payment information for accounting, billing and audit purposes and to detect or prevent any fraudulent activities;

Administrative or legal purposes: we use your data for statistical and marketing analysis, systems testing, customer surveys, maintenance, and development, or in order to deal with a dispute or claim. We may perform data profiling based on the data we collect from you for statistical and marketing analysis purposes, but only with your prior consent, and by making best endeavors to ensure that all data it is based on is accurate. By providing any personal data you explicitly agree that we may use it to perform profiling activities in accordance with this privacy policy;

Security, health, administrative, crime prevention/detection: we may pass your information to government authorities or enforcement bodies for compliance with legal requirements;

Customer service communications: we use your data to manage our relationship with you as our customer and to improve our services and enhance your experience with us;

Provide tailored services: we use your data to provide information we believe is of interest to you, prior to, during, and after your interactions with us, and to personalize the services we offer to you, such as special offers.

We will only process your personal data where we have a legal basis to do so, which will depend on the reasons for which we have collected and need to use your personal data.

In most cases, we will need to process your personal data so that we can enter into our contract and fulfill the provision or delivery of goods or services to you.

We may also process your personal data for one or more of the following:

To comply with a legal obligation;

Where you have consented to our using your personal data (eg. for marketing related uses);

To protect your vital interests or those of another person (eg. in case of a medical emergency);

If it is in our legitimate interests to do so (eg. for administrative purposes).

Only children above a certain age (generally 16 years or older, but varying from country to country) can provide their own consent. For children under this age, the knowledge and consent of the parents or legal guardians is required.

We will not retain your data for longer than is necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it is being processed. To determine the appropriate retention period, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the purposes for which we process it, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means.

We also consider the periods for which we might need to retain personal data in order to meet our legal obligations, or to deal with complaints and queries, and to protect our legal rights in the event of a claim being made.

When we no longer need your personal data, we will securely delete or destroy it. We will also consider if and how we can minimize over time the personal data that we use, and if we can anonymize your personal data so that it can no longer be associated with you or identify you, in which case we may use that information without further notice to you.

Security of your personal data

We follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of your personal data, and to protect it against accidental loss, destruction or damage. The data you provide to us is protected using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) technology. SSL is the industry standard method of encrypting personal information and credit card details so that they can be securely transferred over the Internet.

Sharing your personal data

Your personal data may be shared with other companies within My Swing Evolution LLC.

We may also share your personal data with the following third parties for the purpose described in this privacy policy:

Government authorities, law enforcement bodies and regulators for compliance with legal requirements;

Other companies, contractors or agents to provide services to you including delivery, marketing, support ticket providers (which may include Zendesk), or marketing platform providers (which may include Emarsys), communications, legal services, debt collection, administration services, customer services, information technology providers, credit card or other payment methods to conduct transactions;

The host of our online store (Shopify Inc.), which provides us with the online e-commerce platform that allows us to sell our products and services to you. Your data is stored through Shopify’s data storage, databases, and the general Shopify application. By using services provided by Shopify Inc. you agree to their terms and conditions, which are available at https://www.shopify.com/legal/ terms , including their privacy policy;

Credit and debit card companies which facilitate your payments to us, and for anti-fraud screening, which may need information about your method of payment to process payment or ensure the security of your payment transaction. These may include third-party payment gateway providers, including at www.stripe.com or www. paypal.com or www.apple.com . Before entering your personal details we suggest that you read and become familiar with the privacy policy for any such third-party provider;

Legal and other professional advisers, law courts and law enforcement bodies in countries in which we operate, in order to enforce our legal rights in relation to our contract with you;

Our trusted third party ancillary partners (identified on our website), who may offer products and services on or through our website. If you choose to purchase products or services offered on our websites by third parties, you may be a customer of both My Swing Evolution LLC and these third parties, and we and our partners may collect and share information about you, such as your contact details and your billing information. We are not responsible for third parties’ use of your personal data where such use is permitted for their own purposes. You should consult their privacy policies for further information.

Social media: You may be able to access third-party social media services through our website or app or before coming to our website or app. When you are registered with your social media account, we will obtain the personal data you choose to share with us through these social media services pursuant to their privacy settings in order to improve and personalize your use of our website or app. We may also use social media plugins on our website or app. As a result, your information will be shared with your social media provider and possibly presented on your social media profile to be shared with others in your network. Please refer to the privacy policy of those third-party social media providers to find out more about these practices.

International Data Transfer

My Swing Evolution LLC operates businesses in multiple jurisdictions, some of which are not located in the European Union or European Economic Area (EEA). While countries outside the EEA do not always have strong data protection laws, we require all services providers to process your information in a secure manner and in accordance with EU and other applicable laws on privacy and data protection.

Cookies and site tracking

We may collect data from other sources which may not always be obvious, such as through the use of “cookies”. We may also gather information from both online and offline data providers. This information could include internet browsing behavior, demographic data or interest-based data.

A cookie is a small text file stored on your computer that contains information that helps the website to identify and track the visitor. Cookies do no harm to your computer, consist only of text, cannot contain viruses, and occupy virtually no space on your hard drive.

Two types of cookies are used: ""Session Cookies"", and cookies that are saved permanently on your computer. The first type of cookie commonly used is ""Session Cookies"". During the time you visit the website, our web server assigns your browser a unique identifier string so as not to confuse you with other visitors. A ""Session Cookie"" is never stored permanently on your computer and disappears when you close your browser. To use some of our websites without troubles you need to have cookies enabled.

The second type of cookie saves a file permanently on your computer. This type of cookie is used to track how visitors move around on the website. This is only used to offer visitors better services and support. The text files can be deleted. On this website, we use this type of cookie to keep track of your shopping cart and to keep statistics of our visitors. The information stored on your computer is only a unique number, without any connection to personal information.

Here is a list of cookies that we currently use. We have listed them here so you that you can choose if you want to opt-out of cookies or not:

_session_id, unique token, sessional, allows Shopify to store information about your session (referrer, landing page, etc).

_shopify_visit, no data held, persistent for 30 minutes from the last visit, Used by our website provider’s internal stats tracker to record the number of visits

_shopify_uniq, no data held, expires midnight (relative to the visitor) of the next day, counts the number of visits to a store by a single customer.

_cart_, unique token, persistent for 2 weeks, stores information about the contents of your cart.

_secure_session_id, unique token, sessional storefront_digest, unique token, indefinite; if the shop has a password, this is used to determine if the current visitor has access.

To opt out of cookies, you can alter the settings on your internet browser to accept or reject a website from using cookies. This may affect the functionality of the website. Some third parties may use cookies and other technologies. We recommend that you read their privacy policies or policies relating to the use of cookies and technology.

When you browse our store, we automatically receive your computer’s internet protocol (IP) address in order to provide us with information that helps us learn about your browser and operating system.

We may also collect data: regarding device IDs or identifiers, connection information, device software, statistics of page views, ad data, referral URLs and IP data; to determine your general geographic location, so that we can provide location-specific content to you; to assist in responding to complaints and queries; to investigate any possible breach of our terms or conditions including fraud or illegal activities with the use of your personal data; and with your permission, we may send you emails about our store, new products, and other updates.

If we do ask for your personal information for a secondary purpose such as marketing and you are an individual in the European Economic Area (EEA), we will either ask you directly for your express consent or provide you with an opportunity to say no. If after you opt-in, you change your mind, you may withdraw your consent for us to contact you for the continued collection, use or disclosure of your information, at any time, by contacting us or by using the unsubscribe link within any of our emails. If you are outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), you may withdraw your consent for us to contact you for the continued collection, use or disclosure of your information, at any time, by contacting us or by using the unsubscribe link within any of our emails.

We use tracking software to monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop the design and layout of websites. This software does not enable us to capture any of your data.

Your personal information will not be shared, sold, rented or disclosed other than as described in this privacy policy.

Data Protection Officer

We have appointed a Data Protection Officer (“DPO”) to oversee compliance with this policy. You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the supervisory authority. The data protection supervisory authority for you depends upon the country or geographical area in which you are located.

Your Data Protection Rights

Under certain circumstances, by law, you have the right to:

Request information about whether we hold personal information about you, and, if so, what that information is and why we are holding/using it.

Request access to your personal information (commonly known as a ""data subject access request""). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.

Request correction of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.

Request erasure of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see e. below).

Object to the processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.

Object to automated decision-making including profiling, that is not to be subject of any automated decision-making by us using your personal information or profiling of you.

Request the restriction of processing of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you, for example, if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.

Request transfer of your personal information in an electronic and structured form to you or to another party (commonly known as a right to “data portability”). This enables you to take your data from us in an electronically useable format and to be able to transfer your data to another party in an electronically useable format.

Withdraw consent. In the limited circumstances where you may have provided your consent to the collection, processing, and transfer of your personal information for a specific purpose, you have the right to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time. Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose or purposes to which you originally agreed, unless we have another proper and legitimate basis for doing so.

If you want to exercise any of these rights, then please contact our DPO by email at christo@myswingevolution. com . Alternatively, if you are an Australian resident you can also contact our Privacy Compliance Officer at the same email address: christo@ myswingevolution.com

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly completely unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.

Changes to Privacy Policy

Our privacy policy may change from time to time. Any changes will be communicated to you by way of an e-mail or a notice on our website.

Under certain circumstances, by law, you have the right to:

Request information about whether we hold personal information about you, and, if so, what that information is and why we are holding/using it.

Request access to your personal information (commonly known as a ""data subject access request""). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.

Request correction of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.

Request erasure of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see e. below).

Object to the processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.

Object to automated decision-making including profiling, that is not to be subject of any automated decision-making by us using your personal information or profiling of you.

Request the restriction of processing of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you, for example, if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.

Request transfer of your personal information in an electronic and structured form to you or to another party (commonly known as a right to “data portability”). This enables you to take your data from us in an electronically useable format and to be able to transfer your data to another party in an electronically useable format.

Withdraw consent. In the limited circumstances where you may have provided your consent to the collection, processing, and transfer of your personal information for a specific purpose, you have the right to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time. Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose or purposes to which you originally agreed, unless we have another proper and legitimate basis for doing so.

If you want to exercise any of these rights, then please contact our DPO by email at christo@myswingevolution. com . Alternatively, if you are an Australian resident you can also contact our Privacy Compliance Officer at the same email address: christo@ myswingevolution.com

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly completely unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.

Our privacy policy may change from time to time. Any changes will be communicated to you by way of an e-mail or a notice on our website.",14.06,3514

A Complete Guide to Third-Party Warehousing & Distribution for Retailers

Posted on January 24, 2020 March 28, 2022 by Aero Fulfillment

Facebook Tweet Pin LinkedIn

Millions of retailers have become etailers as more and more shoppers choose to make their purchases online.

Smart Insights estimates that consumer spending over the Internet accounted for $3.5 trillion in sales in 2019 and will pass $4.2 trillion in 2020. The research company projects that online customers will spend $6.5 trillion in 2023. Online sales are growing at an annual rate of about 15 percent, increasing the need for many third party warehouses.

With more and more sales online, more and more retail companies are making third-party warehousing and distribution a critical part of their program for success throughout the entire process. Third-party warehousing and distribution free up construction capital and eliminate rental expenses. These companies reduce inventory holding costs. They liberate both online and brick-and-mortar retailers and companies from the many hassles of picking, packing , and shipping products, as well as dealing with returns. Third-party warehousing is a critical aspect of the supply chain of a business and their logistics services. The right third-party warehousing and distribution partner can make a critical difference in the success of any retail company by saving time and aiding in many third-party logistics for your company.

Wait a minute. Is third-party warehousing and distribution the same as drop-shipping?

Third-party warehousing and distribution is not the same as drop shipping. Third-party warehousing and distribution, which you may also see described as third-party fulfillment or third-party logistics differs from drop-shipping services in one critical way:

Retailers who use third-party warehousing and distribution services retain ownership and control over their inventory. Retailers who use drop-shipping services do not.

The drop shipment model uses retailers to provide a digital storefront for products the drop shipment company owns. Multiple digital marketers and companies may be displaying storefronts for the same product at the same price. These marketing companies usually rely on the content of their sites to drive sales. If they can just put out enough free information that gets the attention of search engines and converts to the occasional click, then they can get a commission on sales of the drop-shipped product.

There are digital marketers who do well with the drop shipment model. They are a small minority of those who try, but it’s possible to eke out profits in this system. The third-party warehousing and distribution model is quite different — and potentially much more profitable. In third-party warehousing and distribution, retailers own both their digital storefront and their inventory. These companies choose their own stock. They set their own prices. But they do not have to buy or rent warehouse space. The business or companies have ownership of the services in the supply chain and the logistics that come with that.

Retailers who choose third-party warehousing and distribution do not have to invest in workers to prepare orders for shipment to customers, and they don’t have to run a “complaints department” to track down problems in shipping services or to deal with defective product returns and the logistics of these issues. And if they choose the right third-party warehousing and distribution partner, they don’t have to deal with just-in-time logistics, choices among carrier companies to optimize freight costs, sales analytics, and the inevitable problems of having inventory in one location and a surge of customers on the other side of the country. Many companies use third-party warehousing because they like the financial benefits that come with control of the supply chain services in their business.

Third-party warehousing and distribution can free retailers to do what they do best: Creating new products to keep consumers happy. But it helps to have a clear idea of exactly what third-party warehousing and distribution does.

What is a third-party warehouse?

A third-party warehouse is a storage facility owned by a commercial provider outside your company. Providers of third-party warehouse services go through several steps to serve your needs.

The first step is set-up. Your third-party warehouse keeps up with all the details and logistics of receiving inventory from your suppliers. They must know your standards for accepting inventory and what to do when your supplier’s services do not meet the terms of your business. The third-party warehouse must make sure it can accommodate the many complexities of your business, both in receiving your merchandise and in sending it to your customers.

The next step is receiving and intake. Your third-party warehouse may need to receive your inventory on pallets. They may need to have many workers who can perform the logistics of the process of receiving, documenting, and storing your inventory piece-by-piece. The third-party warehouse must have clear procedures for the logistics of unloading, sorting, counting, entering inventory into their online system, making sure their online system is in sync with yours, and placement within the storage facility.

The third aspect in warehousing is storage. The third-party warehouse keeps your inventory safe and secure until it is picked up. Depending on the size of your product, the warehouse may store your product in bins, on pallets, or on shelves. Your storage costs may be quoted in terms of numbers of items, numbers of pallets, or volume of storage space.

Next up is kitting. Customers dread purchases that come with the warning “some assembly required.” But some items are most efficiently stored as parts and assembled just before they need to be shipped to the customer. This process is called “kitting.” It is a service that your third-party warehouse can provide so you do not have to hire additional staff.Order fulfillment logistics in warehousing looked different twenty years ago. Order fulfillment charges were often referred to as “ pick and pack ” fees. Modern third-party fulfillment, of course, still involves the pick and pack function of shipping out orders to your customers, but this function is integrated with information technology. This function ties in with “third-party logistics,” which ensures that your inventory comes in and out of warehousing as fast as needed so it can go out smoothly.

Shipping third-party fulfillment can achieve considerable reductions in shipping costs. UPS, FedEx, DHL, and the trucking companies all offer price breaks when they can send an empty truck to a warehouse and drive it away full. Maybe your retail business generates enough sales that you can take advantage of reduced rates for shipping. Maybe if it doesn’t now, it eventually will. But in the meantime, your lowest shipping costs are available through third-party fulfillment warehousing.

Account management. Your third-party warehouse can handle calls about shipments into your inventory and out to your customers. It can deal with customer inquiries about order fulfillment services and the warehousing logistics. And it can provide you with detailed data about revenues and costs to act as a check on your internal accounting systems.

As you can see, providing third-party warehouse services is about more than just providing a building. It is about more than just fulfilling orders. The use of a third-party fulfillment and warehousing provides essential services at lower cost. And it provides essential information for the business decisions you make that grow your company.

How does third-party logistics work? What are the advantages of third-party logistics?

What makes third-party logistics work for your company? How can you cost out the advantages of third-party fulfillment?

The cost accounting of in-house inventor and order fulfillment gets a little complicated. There are numerous factors and logistics to consider and your accountants will have numerous rules to follow. It can be hard to put a number to the cost of order fulfillment handled within the company.

What is the role of third party logistics providers?

Third-party warehousing and distribution is the cost-effective choice for most retailers involved in eCommerce . But how can online retailers recognize the right third-party warehousing and distribution company?

Third-party fulfillment should lower your overhead but also increase your throughput.

Third-party fulfillment should lower costs of storing inventory and fulfilling orders. It should also increase the number of orders you are able to fill. The right third-party fulfillment provider will do this for you by providing you real-time data on inventory levels and order activity.

Retailers pull product from multiple sources. They get their inventory from wholesalers. They get their inventory directly from manufacturers. Sometimes they accept inventory on consignment.

Every retailer’s inventory management system must tie into all of their supply channels so they will know how to restock when inventories are low. Your fulfillment provider should be able to update your customer’s shopping cart with current inventory levels. Your warehousing and fulfillment provider should be able to help you maintain your standards for minimum and maximum levels of items in stock and have built-in alerts to notify your supervisors when those levels are reached. Your third-party warehousing and fulfillment center should provide you with real-time data and logistics that helps you make sure you don’t lose orders because your business doesn’t have the goods to sell.

Third-party fulfillment should be able to handle unexpectedly high order volume.

No retailer or business wants to lose out on a rush because they can’t get orders out. Every retailer needs to understand how their third-party fulfillment provider will handle unexpectedly high volumes of orders. If your third-party logistics provider relies on seasonal or temporary workers, the results can be disastrous unless your provider has standard operating procedures in place and a warehouse management system that optimizes workflow.

A warehouse management system — which is something your provider works out to ensure you receive excellent service — learns from experience. Your fulfillment center will learn how to streamline movements. It will avoid unnecessary repetition of work and services. It will become more efficient in providing service to you the longer it serves your account. Your fulfillment provider should be able to tell you how they store your inventory so your most-picked items are closest to their staging area and your least-picked items are greater distance, so your orders can be sent out as quickly as possible.

Ask your third-party fulfillment provider if they use batch or wave picking. Batch picking eliminates redundant trips to the same inventory location. Wave picking allows the warehouse manager to view a large volume of orders and pick the best routes for transporting merchandise from storage to staging. You won’t supervise the warehouse’s use of these methods, but it is good to know whether they are in place.

Third-party fulfillment should have procedures to ensure pick and pack accuracy.

Customers tend to be unforgiving when they pay for and receive merchandise they didn’t want and didn’t approve. Inaccurate order fulfillment loses sales, loses customers, damages brand, and hits the bottom line. Your third-party fulfillment provider should be able to show you how their equipment, technology, and procedures ensure that the right inventory is shipped to the customer.

Barcode scanners ensure that the item picked matches the product number on the order. Fulfillment centers at the very least should be able to answer your questions about barcode scanners, and to show you how they keep barcodes, SKUs, and your product numbers in alignment. Your logistics provider should show you that they can track, trace and authenticate any product and monitor its environment anytime and anywhere.The many services and logistics of your supply chain need to be seamless.

Third-party fulfillment should lower shipping costs.

New retailers will not have the sales volume that allows them to negotiate shipping costs for your company or business. Third-party fulfillment centers will. A fulfillment center can batch all of its shipments from your business to take advantage of the lowest available freight rates. A good fulfillment center can take advantage of multiple relationships with freight companies to drive down costs.

But the special relationship of third-party logistics providers to freight companies does not just lower shipping cost. Third-party fulfillment can get products out faster. The third-party fulfillment center will almost always have a third-party shipping application that integrates their fulfillment center services to the carrier’s tracking system. Drivers don’t have to wait for the shipping department to print labels and fill out paperwork for their services. Additionally, those who integrate with multiple carriers reap the benefits of comparison shopping that can be passed along to the client.

Third-party fulfillment should have processes in place to enhance customer experience.

Modern consumers have many choices when it comes to the service they chose. They have unlimited access to product information from any company. They can tap the experiences of other consumers through product reviews. They can post their opinions of products from any business for the world to see.

Modern retailers must take every step to ensure they deliver on their brand promise and differentiate themselves among their competitors. Your third-party fulfillment center should be able to tell you how they can help you customize your customer’s product experience.

Retailers invest significant time, professional expertise, and capital in choosing products of unique value and in providing a unique online experience. Their third-party fulfillment providers can help give customers outstanding value and satisfaction while giving them turn-key control over inventory. The secret to achieving these advantages is choosing the right third-party warehousing and distribution partner.

A Complete Guide to Third-Party Warehousing & Distribution for Retailers

Millions of retailers have become etailers as more and more shoppers choose to make their purchases online.

Smart Insights estimates that consumer spending over the Internet accounted for $3.5 trillion in sales in 2019 and will pass $4.2 trillion in 2020. The research company projects that online customers will spend $6.5 trillion in 2023. Online sales are growing at an annual rate of about 15 percent, increasing the need for many third party warehouses.

With more and more sales online, more and more retail companies are making third-party warehousing and distribution a critical part of their program for success throughout the entire process. Third-party warehousing and distribution free up construction capital and eliminate rental expenses. These companies reduce inventory holding costs. They liberate both online and brick-and-mortar retailers and companies from the many hassles of picking, packing , and shipping products, as well as dealing with returns. Third-party warehousing is a critical aspect of the supply chain of a business and their logistics services. The right third-party warehousing and distribution partner can make a critical difference in the success of any retail company by saving time and aiding in many third-party logistics for your company.

Wait a minute. Is third-party warehousing and distribution the same as drop-shipping?

Third-party warehousing and distribution is not the same as drop shipping. Third-party warehousing and distribution, which you may also see described as third-party fulfillment or third-party logistics differs from drop-shipping services in one critical way:

Retailers who use third-party warehousing and distribution services retain ownership and control over their inventory. Retailers who use drop-shipping services do not.

The drop shipment model uses retailers to provide a digital storefront for products the drop shipment company owns. Multiple digital marketers and companies may be displaying storefronts for the same product at the same price. These marketing companies usually rely on the content of their sites to drive sales. If they can just put out enough free information that gets the attention of search engines and converts to the occasional click, then they can get a commission on sales of the drop-shipped product.

There are digital marketers who do well with the drop shipment model. They are a small minority of those who try, but it’s possible to eke out profits in this system. The third-party warehousing and distribution model is quite different — and potentially much more profitable. In third-party warehousing and distribution, retailers own both their digital storefront and their inventory. These companies choose their own stock. They set their own prices. But they do not have to buy or rent warehouse space. The business or companies have ownership of the services in the supply chain and the logistics that come with that.

Retailers who choose third-party warehousing and distribution do not have to invest in workers to prepare orders for shipment to customers, and they don’t have to run a “complaints department” to track down problems in shipping services or to deal with defective product returns and the logistics of these issues. And if they choose the right third-party warehousing and distribution partner, they don’t have to deal with just-in-time logistics, choices among carrier companies to optimize freight costs, sales analytics, and the inevitable problems of having inventory in one location and a surge of customers on the other side of the country.

Substance Use

Opioid Use Disorder

substance-use--opioid-use-disorder.jpg

NIH-supported research led to the development of buprenorphine, a medication treatment for opioid addiction. In people who experienced a non-fatal overdose, long-term buprenorphine reduces their likelihood of dying from overdose in the future by 38%.

Image credit: Scott Housley

Flip

In 2017, the opioid crisis was declared a public health emergency by HHS.

In 2020, drug overdose was the leading cause of death for Americans ages 18-45, and more than 2.7 million Americans had an opioid use disorder. For every fatal overdose, it is estimated that there are 10 non-fatal overdoses and 20 opioid-related hospitalizations.

Buprenorphine, approved by FDA in 2002 to treat addiction to opioids, works by helping reduce withdrawal symptoms and drug craving.

Naloxone

substance-use--naloxone.jpeg

NIH research led to the development of easy-to-use naloxone nasal spray, a life-saving tool that rapidly reverses the effects of opioid overdose. Opioid overdose deaths decreased by 14% in states after they enacted naloxone access laws.

Image credit: National Institute on Drug Abuse, NIH

Flip

Between April 2020 and April 2021, over 75,000 people died of opioid overdoses.

In 2015, FDA approved the first naloxone nasal spray—NARCAN®—developed as a result of NIH-funded research.

Naloxone is now the standard treatment to reverse opioid overdose and can be used by both medical professionals and laypersons without formal training.

High rates of naloxone distribution among laypersons and emergency personnel could avert 21% of opioid overdose deaths, and the majority of overdose death reduction would result from increased distribution to laypersons.

Tobacco Use

substance-use--tobacco-use.jpg

NIH-funded research on tobacco use has informed public policy interventions and health practices, supporting a two-thirds reduction in smoking over the past 50 years and contributing to a sharp drop in lung cancer rates.

Image credit: Gianandrea Villa on Unsplash

Flip

Smoking in U.S. adults hit an all-time low of 13.7% in 2018—down two-thirds since the U.S. Surgeon General issued a landmark report on the health consequences of smoking 50 years ago.

Smoke-free policies decrease smoking rates, help to promote quitting, de-normalize tobacco use, and reduce exposure to secondhand smoke.

Increasing the price of tobacco products through taxation prevents smoking initiation, promotes quitting, and reduces prevalence and intensity of tobacco use among youth and adult users.

NIH-funded programs provide tools and tips to the public on quitting smoking.

Back

E-Cigarettes

substance-use--e-cigarettes.jpeg

In an effort to curb tobacco use in children and teenagers, in 2020 FDA released a policy—informed by NIH-supported research—to restrict the sale of e-cigarette flavors that appeal to kids, including fruit and mint flavors. This has led FDA to deny marketing applications for over 55,000 flavored e-cigarette products.

Image credit: Drew Walker on Unsplash

Flip

The NIH-supported Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) study findings indicate that flavored e-cigarette products appeal to youth and promote initiation of vaping.

The NIH-supported Monitoring the Future (MTF) study findings indicate that youth are particularly attracted to cartridge-based e-cigarette flavors such as fruit and mint.

Data from MTF show that, prior to 2020, there were dramatic increases in teen vaping, which leveled off in 2020 and decreased in 2021.

NIH-supported research led to the development of buprenorphine, a medication treatment for opioid addiction. In people who experienced a non-fatal overdose, long-term buprenorphine reduces their likelihood of dying from overdose in the future by 38%.

In 2017, the opioid crisis was declared a public health emergency by HHS.

In 2020, drug overdose was the leading cause of death for Americans ages 18-45, and more than 2.7 million Americans had an opioid use disorder. For every fatal overdose, it is estimated that there are 10 non-fatal overdoses and 20 opioid-related hospitalizations.

Buprenorphine, approved by FDA in 2002 to treat addiction to opioids, works by helping reduce withdrawal symptoms and drug craving.

NIH research led to the development of easy-to-use naloxone nasal spray, a life-saving tool that rapidly reverses the effects of opioid overdose. Opioid overdose deaths decreased by 14% in states after they enacted naloxone access laws.

Between April 2020 and April 2021, over 75,000 people died of opioid overdoses.

In 2015, FDA approved the first naloxone nasal spray—NARCAN®—developed as a result of NIH-funded research.

Naloxone is now the standard treatment to reverse opioid overdose and can be used by both medical professionals and laypersons without formal training.

High rates of naloxone distribution among laypersons and emergency personnel could avert 21% of opioid overdose deaths, and the majority of overdose death reduction would result from increased distribution to laypersons.

NIH-funded research on tobacco use has informed public policy interventions and health practices, supporting a two-thirds reduction in smoking over the past 50 years and contributing to a sharp drop in lung cancer rates.

Smoking in U.S. adults hit an all-time low of 13.7% in 2018—down two-thirds since the U.S. Surgeon General issued a landmark report on the health consequences of smoking 50 years ago.

Smoke-free policies decrease smoking rates, help to promote quitting, de-normalize tobacco use, and reduce exposure to secondhand smoke.

Increasing the price of tobacco products through taxation prevents smoking initiation, promotes quitting, and reduces prevalence and intensity of tobacco use among youth and adult users.

NIH-funded programs provide tools and tips to the public on quitting smoking.

In an effort to curb tobacco use in children and teenagers, in 2020 FDA released a policy—informed by NIH-supported research—to restrict the sale of e-cigarette flavors that appeal to kids, including fruit and mint flavors. This has led FDA to deny marketing applications for over 55,000 flavored e-cigarette products.

The NIH-supported Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) study findings indicate that flavored e-cigarette products appeal to youth and promote initiation of vaping.

The NIH-supported Monitoring the Future (MTF) study findings indicate that youth are particularly attracted to cartridge-based e-cigarette flavors such as fruit and mint.

Data from MTF show that, prior to 2020, there were dramatic increases in teen vaping, which leveled off in 2020 and decreased in 2021.

Occupational Therapy

Rehabilitation Services (PT/OT) is newly located in Wilson Health's Professional Building, Lower Level

How to Find Us

Each year thousands of people fracture bones, have car accidents, strokes, suffer from arthritis, experience numbness or tingling in their arms or injure their hands in work or household accidents. Any of these injuries or illnesses can severely affect their ability to complete work, provide self-care or enjoy leisure activities.

The goal of occupational therapy is to analyze those limitations resulting from injury or condition and develop a strategic treatment plan. Each treatment plan is individually designed to engage the mind and challenge the body.

With a creative touch, our trained specialists design functional tasks that ultimately improve movement, strength and function. Specialized tools and splints are created when necessary, and patients are given an individualized program to help them meet their goals.

In the workplace, an occupational therapist can assist companies by performing assessments and recommending work site improvements. The results may include returning function to an injured worker or designing a workplace that is safe and efficient.

Who Needs Occupational Therapy?

Often thought of as therapy for everyday living activities, occupational therapy can also offer much more. Just as each person's injury is unique, so is the treatment and equipment we provide.

Creativity is the key to solving a wide array of challenges for all types of people and situations. Common ailments, such as carpal tunnel syndrome and tendonitis, may be relieved through our specialized hand therapy program. More complex situations may require specially created tools or techniques to give an individual more independence.

Regardless of the level of function that needs to be regained, we have the ability to help patients decrease pain and swelling, increase flexibility, mobilize scar tissue and increase function. We educate patients about their conditions and help them progress to a more independent lifestyle.

We Help:

People suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome, tendonitis, crush injuries, tendon lacerations, DeQuervain's, epicondylitis, burns and amputations.

Stroke patients, people with hip replacements and those with Parkinson's Disease.

Individuals who need specially designed tools, equipment, splints or dynamic splints with moving parts.

Employers in need of work reconditioning solutions

Occupational Therapy Services Specialize In:

Hand therapy - Patients requiring outpatient elbow, wrist and hand rehabilitation are given specialized programs designed to eliminate or reduce pain and increase function.

Work reconditioning - Tool adaptations, posture training, task analysis and FCEs (functional capacity evaluations) are among the services provided in the clinic. Special tools are created when needed.

Activities for daily living - We help people learn new ways to do everyday tasks such as performing personal care, eating and doing laundry.

Does Insurance Cover Occupational Therapy?

Most insurances cover occupational therapy services. However, you should always contact your insurance company to find out the amount of coverage and if they require information about your injury or condition.

Time was running out on Torrey Pines Golf Club.

The club, set to host the U.S. Open on its South Course in 2008, had been directed by the United States Golf Association and the PGA Tour to make several changes to the course, which is nestled atop the cliffs along the Southern California coastline in La Jolla, Calif.

With time at a premium and a completion date nearing, the club and its builder, Landscapes Unlimited, encountered a unique problem, however.

It was a win-win-win situation, West Coast Turf's John Marman said of the decision to strip sod from Lake San Marcos Country Club and install it on Torrey Pines' South Course.

First, a little history on the project. Lincoln, Neb.-based Landscapes Unlimited was awarded a contract to convert two relatively short par-5 holes by today's standards into lengthy par 4s as well as the reconstruction of several fairway bunkers. The PGA Tour also requested that the bermudagrass on the golf course be replaced with kikuyugrass in an effort to make the already-predominant kikuyugrass golf course turf type consistent throughout the course. With the remodeling nearing completion and the golf course contractor needing sod, an unexpected problem arose.

The sod, which was to be custom grown, couldn't be harvested on time because of its lack of growth and establishment during a colder than normal winter. There was a solution to the problem, however, and it involved another golf course in San Diego, as well as Landscapes Unlimited and West Coast Turf.

With golfers playing off bare soil in anticipation of the sod, a decision was made to strip the sod from the nearby Lake San Marcos Country Club fairways. Lake San Marcos was doing the opposite of Torrey Pines. The course's officials wanted to take out the kikuyugrass fairways and replace them with hybrid bermudagrass. Kikuyugrass will perform better along the coast as opposed to slightly inland areas such as Lake San Marcos. West Coast Turf personnel performed the job to help Landscapes Unlimited finish the project.

""I guess you could say it was a win-win-win situation for all parties involved,"" said West Coast Turf spokesperson John Marman. ""Landscapes Unlimited was thrilled to finish the job on time, Torrey Pines now has wall-to-wall kikuyugrass on the South Course, and Lake San Marcos received the hybrid bermudagrass fairways it desired without having to pay costly disposal fees.""

Universities - The New Context

Universities in Canada today are booming as a result of the double cohort. But after the boom will come the bust. Here is how I see the future.

How will Universities Cope?

We live today in one of those periodic times, when shifts in beliefs and in communication technology drive a fundamental change in how power is defined and exercised. What are these trends and how do they manifest themselves in the lives of universities? How can universities, with their unique cultures and management processes, cope and even prosper in this type of environment?

What is going on? What are these trends and what do they mean for managing a University? In particular, what do they mean for the social and human aspects that HR will have to plan for?

A revolution in demography - By 2020, most people in the developed world will be over 50. This is a unique demographic event in the history of nature. This aging of society will affect all aspects of the social and work world. It will be especially challenging for organizations that rely on a stream of young customers or those who rely on the young to replace the old as participants. Universities are vulnerable in both ends of the age spectrum. Who will teach? Who will be the students? How will we attract and retain staff and students? Our previous assumptions about the answers to these questions will have to be revisited.

A revolution in values . There is a pronounced shift in organizational values in the developed world. The shift is from an acceptance in organizations of a top down and process driven approach toward a new set of values that built on self-expression and dialogue. This values' shift is proving a challenge to all organizations In particular, all ""customer"" interfaces in every field of service delivery are being challenged by this new values set. There is no reason why institutions of learning should be exempt from this shift. where the managerial culture is authoritarian. For academia, the shift is especially challenging as it demands also a shift in pedagogy from where the teacher and content is the centre piece to where the student and dialogue is the centre piece. What is meant by this shift? What is the right course to take? How will we get there? Our current approach to delivery and to teaching itself has to re-evaluated.

A revolution in technology - It is not an illusion, the pace of technological change is accelerating in a non-linear manner. The web revolution has however only just begun. The impact on society will be similar to the advent of the railway which radically changed how and where people lived and worked in the 19th century. We can expect no less of a revolution today. While the new design for society is not yet clear, the new design for service delivery is emerging with some clarity. New technology enables the customer to access the service provider on his terms and at times that suit the customer. The new manufacturing process, as developed by Dell, has turned the Ford model of make and sell on its head. The adversarial customer relationship of the transaction economy, is being replaced by a community and relationship based model as exemplified by eBay and Amazon. How will this affect education? Many say that education is different. This may be a dangerous assumption. These technological and cultural forces are located already on the edge of the Academic world and are becoming ubiquitous. They fit the new values and they fit the new service/cost criteria as we are seeing in the airline industry. They will bear down on how universities operate. What will happen to high cost, place and content based universities when an educational equivalent of Southwest Airlines or EBay emerges? Other organizations in other sectors that have not thought about this threat now face extinction.

A revolution in educational costs and service expectations - A generation ago, post secondary education was an elite process. Now it is expected to be accessible to most young people. This has lead to a massive expansion in the scale of universities and to a new and challenging relationship with government. Governments, in many parts of the developed world, see universities as engines of economic and social development. As Governments pay many of the bills, their social and economic expectations are becoming important parts of the university agenda. In response, Universities have had little choice but to adopt many of the features of the industrial workplace. Mass production of content and mass processing of students has enabled student participation to rise but at the cost of a significant increase in infrastructure costs and a corresponding reduction in organizational flexibility. Development and fund raising have become critical skills of the President. Coping with Unions and labour relations has become an important Presidential skill. As a result, the culture of business is seeping though the academic world. Paradoxically, as more students participate and as the direct and indirect costs of education rise for the student, the value of a BA is devalued in the work place. The average student can no longer afford a 4 year term at university away from home. Something in the cost mix will have to break. The current system cannot deliver the price and the quality that the student can afford and that the staff can tolerate. The result is a growing conflict between the internal stakeholders. All the stakeholders intuitively sense that something has to give but have circled their own wagons to defend themselves. How can Universities break the deadlock between their constituent parts? Is it likely that the conventional process of fighting this out at the bargaining table will work? What new process would give us the chance of reconciling the fears of the competing groups?

What operational issues will be exposed by these trends? - Bearing in mind, a very small pool and a huge demand, how will we attract and retain the key academic and specialist staff that we need? Rank this issue in importance? Is this a survival issue or just a tough one to deal with? What are the financial implications of getting this wrong? What are the reputational issues of getting this wrong? How important will dealing with the subset issues such as pay and work place culture be to the attraction and retention issues? Is money the only issue? What can you afford bearing mind the pressure on the cost front?

Is transforming our costs merely about finding new cuts or will they come from a redesign of how we do things? How will conventional cuts affect the ability of the university to deliver? What will happen to morale and to students? What will increasing risk of more internal conflict mean?

Will finding more effective and ways of teaching more for less be about the application of new technology or is it about finding a way to change our mindsets about how to do this differently?

Is affecting change itself an issue of power or is it an issue of understanding how we change from a psycho-social perspective. How important is being able to change?

How important is it to reduce the centrifugal forces that are affecting our university? Can this be done as a matter of power or are there social and organizational design issues involved?

How can we reduce the inertial and complexity drag of our union environment? How important is this in a rapidly changing world? Can we use power to do this?

Our health and benefits costs are growing at a non linear rate. How substantive is the threat to our financial health? Is solving this issue a matter of power or design?

The reaction to these trends by the key players. Many universities have no process to engage the interests of the entire university but have highly developed processes to defend the interests of particular parts. The centrifugal forces are building. Like Canada itself, the position of the centre is under siege at a time when the strategic issues are so complex and challenging that they can neither be solved in the President's office nor by each faculty acting alone. Simplistic thinking tells us that we should centralize or that we should decentralize. Our national discourse is full of these ideas. Is there a better way?

What is at the heart of the challenge? The core issues are social and cultural. They are about core beliefs and identity. The risk is to assume that our current process of adjudication can solve tensions of this nature when the stakes are survival and the issues are shaped as paradoxes.

Imposing a the central will of the president will work no better for a university that for Canada. Nor will balkanization work. Our management process has been designed for a more simple time. We need a new way of solving complex problems.

What are the principles of a process that has a good chance of coping with these challenges?

Sharing the Burden - The core principle is to shift the burden of solving these many challenges and paradoxes from the office of the President on to the leaders of all the key stakeholders at a university. When all the stakeholders are at the table, and when they are collectively responsible, then there is a chance that as a group they may act responsibly.

Shifting the organizational metaphor from machine to network - So long as we use the machine as our organizational metaphor, we tend to seek autonomy as the solution. This sets up an irreconcilable tension between the centre and the parts. There is no way that the issues confronting universities today can be solved in an environment of power tension. It is no coincidence that our new organizational metaphor is the web - a network. Networks have at their centre not an office or a person but a set of protocols. There is no ebb and flow of power from the centre to the parts and no waste of energy in this type of fruitless conflict. If a university was configured as a network, the primary role of the governing body would be to set the principles or protocols that provide the value and the connecting rules of the network. Who would be the Governing body? The empowered representatives of the owners of the network.

Making the shift from Interest to Principle - In a diverse environment with many stakeholders, there is no way of reconciling competing interests. But it is possible to raise the strategic debate at the University level to that of principle. At the level of principle, agreement is possible in a diverse society that has many interests such as a modern university. Once there is agreement on principle, the needs of diversity can be met by a subsequent process of design. In networks, significant local diversity is possible once the protocols for membership have been defined. Visa International or Interac are good examples of a model in practice. What would a set of principles be that could support a shift to a network and solve the competing differences between the stakeholders? Would they be mainly technical or social and cultural?

Intellectual heavy lifting - access to the distributed intelligence of the university is required - The issues are so complex that no single person or perspective can solve them. It will be essential for the governing body for the university will have to tap into the broad intellectual capital of the organization. It is ironic that the concept of a learning organization has largely escaped the world of the university that has so much latent talent. In a world that is defined by barriers and silos, how do we create the essential horizontal linkages? What practice can we draw on to help us do this?

Facilitation is the lubricant of cultural change and of learning breakthroughs. - While some truly exceptional intellects do achieve breakthroughs on their own, most of us have had the benefit of mentors or supervisors - especially in the early stage of our intellectual career. In addition to our intellectual development, no one who has made a significant lifestyle change has made this on their own without the support of peers. No organization has transformed itself without the agency of facilitation.

What are the skills of facilitation? What best practice can we rely on to help us acquire these skills?

What do these principles imply? They imply conceiving the university as a network. It implies that having diverse parts is not only legitimate but desirable.

Universities - The New Context

Universities in Canada today are booming as a result of the double cohort. But after the boom will come the bust. Here is how I see the future.

How will Universities Cope?

We live today in one of those periodic times, when shifts in beliefs and in communication technology drive a fundamental change in how power is defined and exercised. What are these trends and how do they manifest themselves in the lives of universities? How can universities, with their unique cultures and management processes, cope and even prosper in this type of environment?

What is going on? What are these trends and what do they mean for managing a University? In particular, what do they mean for the social and human aspects that HR will have to plan for?

A revolution in demography - By 2020, most people in the developed world will be over 50. This is a unique demographic event in the history of nature. This aging of society will affect all aspects of the social and work world. It will be especially challenging for organizations that rely on a stream of young customers or those who rely on the young to replace the old as participants. Universities are vulnerable in both ends of the age spectrum. Who will teach? Who will be the students? How will we attract and retain staff and students? Our previous assumptions about the answers to these questions will have to be revisited.

A revolution in values . There is a pronounced shift in organizational values in the developed world. The shift is from an acceptance in organizations of a top down and process driven approach toward a new set of values that built on self-expression and dialogue. This values' shift is proving a challenge to all organizations In particular, all ""customer"" interfaces in every field of service delivery are being challenged by this new values set. There is no reason why institutions of learning should be exempt from this shift. where the managerial culture is authoritarian. For academia, the shift is especially challenging as it demands also a shift in pedagogy from where the teacher and content is the centre piece to where the student and dialogue is the centre piece. What is meant by this shift? What is the right course to take? How will we get there? Our current approach to delivery and to teaching itself has to re-evaluated.

A revolution in technology - It is not an illusion, the pace of technological change is accelerating in a non-linear manner. The web revolution has however only just begun.

Universities in Canada today are booming as a result of the double cohort. But after the boom will come the bust. Here is how I see the future.

We live today in one of those periodic times, when shifts in beliefs and in communication technology drive a fundamental change in how power is defined and exercised. What are these trends and how do they manifest themselves in the lives of universities? How can universities, with their unique cultures and management processes, cope and even prosper in this type of environment?

What is going on? What are these trends and what do they mean for managing a University? In particular, what do they mean for the social and human aspects that HR will have to plan for?

A revolution in demography - By 2020, most people in the developed world will be over 50. This is a unique demographic event in the history of nature. This aging of society will affect all aspects of the social and work world.

What is meant by this shift? What is the right course to take? How will we get there? Our current approach to delivery and to teaching itself has to re-evaluated.

A revolution in technology - It is not an illusion, the pace of technological change is accelerating in a non-linear manner. The web revolution has however only just begun. The impact on society will be similar to the advent of the railway which radically changed how and where people lived and worked in the 19th century. We can expect no less of a revolution today. While the new design for society is not yet clear, the new design for service delivery is emerging with some clarity. New technology enables the customer to access the service provider on his terms and at times that suit the customer. The new manufacturing process, as developed by Dell, has turned the Ford model of make and sell on its head. The adversarial customer relationship of the transaction economy, is being replaced by a community and relationship based model as exemplified by eBay and Amazon. How will this affect education? Many say that education is different. This may be a dangerous assumption. These technological and cultural forces are located already on the edge of the Academic world and are becoming ubiquitous. They fit the new values and they fit the new service/cost criteria as we are seeing in the airline industry. They will bear down on how universities operate. What will happen to high cost, place and content based universities when an educational equivalent of Southwest Airlines or EBay emerges? Other organizations in other sectors that have not thought about this threat now face extinction.

A revolution in educational costs and service expectations - A generation ago, post secondary education was an elite process. Now it is expected to be accessible to most young people. This has lead to a massive expansion in the scale of universities and to a new and challenging relationship with government. Governments, in many parts of the developed world, see universities as engines of economic and social development. As Governments pay many of the bills, their social and economic expectations are becoming important parts of the university agenda. In response, Universities have had little choice but to adopt many of the features of the industrial workplace. Mass production of content and mass processing of students has enabled student participation to rise but at the cost of a significant increase in infrastructure costs and a corresponding reduction in organizational flexibility. Development and fund raising have become critical skills of the President. Coping with Unions and labour relations has become an important Presidential skill. As a result, the culture of business is seeping though the academic world. Paradoxically, as more students participate and as the direct and indirect costs of education rise for the student, the value of a BA is devalued in the work place.

The current system cannot deliver the price and the quality that the student can afford and that the staff can tolerate. The result is a growing conflict between the internal stakeholders. All the stakeholders intuitively sense that something has to give but have circled their own wagons to defend themselves. How can Universities break the deadlock between their constituent parts? Is it likely that the conventional process of fighting this out at the bargaining table will work? What new process would give us the chance of reconciling the fears of the competing groups?

What operational issues will be exposed by these trends? - Bearing in mind, a very small pool and a huge demand, how will we attract and retain the key academic and specialist staff that we need? Rank this issue in importance? Is this a survival issue or just a tough one to deal with? What are the financial implications of getting this wrong? What are the reputational issues of getting this wrong? How important will dealing with the subset issues such as pay and work place culture be to the attraction and retention issues? Is money the only issue? What can you afford bearing mind the pressure on the cost front?

Is transforming our costs merely about finding new cuts or will they come from a redesign of how we do things? How will conventional cuts affect the ability of the university to deliver? What will happen to morale and to students? What will increasing risk of more internal conflict mean?

Will finding more effective and ways of teaching more for less be about the application of new technology or is it about finding a way to change our mindsets about how to do this differently?

Is affecting change itself an issue of power or is it an issue of understanding how we change from a psycho-social perspective. How important is being able to change?

How important is it to reduce the centrifugal forces that are affecting our university? Can this be done as a matter of power or are there social and organizational design issues involved?

Our health and benefits costs are growing at a non linear rate. How substantive is the threat to our financial health? Is solving this issue a matter of power or design?

The reaction to these trends by the key players.

Description

Innocence of Ina

21 short stories, often based on truth, compromising ignorance and wisdom, unawareness and hair raising sentimental destinies in a background of old fashioned Malta.

If this is a work of fiction, then there is very little invention. All twenty-one stories are loosely based on fact from rakkonti of a previous, and sometimes two or even three previous generations. Of course names have been changed, but the periods are authentic. The stories ramble through from the 1870s to the late 1940s. Ideally they should be read in order, as some continue into a following chapter even though the characters have new names.

These accounts bear testimony to another set of standards. We must remember that what strikes us now as being hair-raisingly naïve, unfair and sometimes cruel, was a system that usually worked quite well; it certainly survived for countless generations. If our hackles are raised and we protest that it did not function successfully, we should ask ourselves whether the new structures and methods we have now have done a good job in replacing the old. Is what we have now causing less turmoil and heartbreak than that which existed before?

Innocence in a number of cases did actually triumph, and the innocent in hindsight would not have had it any other way, mostly thankful and respectful of parents’ love and wisdom. Innocence in the past was prized in all classes of society.

It was always the case that our grandfathers, grand or not, rich, poor, proud, vain or humble, all wanted to marry girls who were innocent and pure as snowflakes or new-born babes.

This little work is an observation and record of how times have changed. We can choose to be amused or we can choose to be alarmed. We can also choose to meditate on the strange experience of life as it manifests itself at different times in different places.

“We believe that people are capable of extraordinary things—that everyone has a gift, and with the right mindset and support, everyone can contribute to the betterment of themselves and others.”

– Charles Koch, founder of Stand Together Go deeper on why the Stand Together community was founded in this FAQ with Charles Koch and our CEO Brian Hooks

Our Vision

(and approach to society’s biggest challenges)

We believe that all people are capable of extraordinary things, but that today there are many barriers and injustices holding people back. And so, we stand together with people across the country to break barriers and move our society toward one where everyone can realize their unique potential and contribute to the lives of others. It’s a big goal that guides everything we do. And we know we can’t achieve it on our own.

We partner with people breaking barriers in education, business, communities, and government. These are the institutions that can make or break a person's ability to succeed. Together, we work to ensure these institutions help empower all people to realize their potential.

Read more about our work and the impact of our teams .

An Empowering Culture

Our management philosophy seeks to empower employees to think and act like entrepreneurs working together toward a shared vision.

Market-Based Management® (MBM®) is the management philosophy and framework our philanthropic community and all employees apply to succeed by helping others improve their lives. It is the approach we use to innovate, improve, and transform ourselves and our work so we realize our potential as employees and help achieve a society in which all people can realize their unique potential. Core to this management philosophy is our MBM Framework and Guiding Principles, which articulate who we are as an organization and guide everything we do.

If you’re someone who embraces and drives change, if you seek knowledge from any and all sources to help you learn and improve your thinking, if you enjoy collaborating with people of diverse perspectives, if you’re excited to take initiative and solve problems, and if you’re committed to the approach of doing well by doing good, then you can thrive in the MBM culture here at Stand Together.

We Celebrate Diversity

There are no ordinary people. Every person has something unique to offer the world.

We believe every person is capable of extraordinary things. The Stand Together community values the unique skills and attributes of each employee because we recognize that real progress only comes with humility and an openness to new ideas. History shows that progress in society rarely springs from a single mind alone. Instead, progress is best achieved when individuals with diverse perspectives stand together to work toward a common purpose.

That’s why in our work, we intentionally bring unique perspectives together around a shared vision of helping every person rise.

We recognize that personal experience informs our perspective and, ultimately, our point of view. Those experiences are influenced by our color, race, religion, religious creed, sex, gender or gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, national origin, citizenship, ethnicity, ancestry, age, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, pregnancy (including medical needs which may arise from pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), military and veteran status, genetic information, marital or familial status, political affiliation, and so much more. Our community provides both the room to be yourself and the support to grow and make a positive difference with your career. This approach offers our team a fulfilling workplace and a diverse professional peer group dedicated to making our country a better place.

We don’t go through the motions of inclusion. We live it, every day. Each employee is accountable for embodying and fostering the values of inclusion, dignity, respect, and humility. At Stand Together everyone is a diversity officer. We are committed to listening and learning how to ensure our workplace and communities are places for open and respectful discussions that can advance meaningful change. Our values are not just words on paper, they are what we live by and hold each other accountable to, every day.

Because every individual has extraordinary gifts, we believe that together we can transform how we tackle our nation’s greatest challenges to help every person rise.

The Stand Together community values the unique skills and attributes of each employee because we recognize that real progress only comes with humility and an openness to new ideas. History shows that progress in society rarely springs from a single mind alone. Instead, progress is best achieved when individuals with diverse perspectives stand together to work toward a common purpose.

That’s why in our work, we intentionally bring unique perspectives together around a shared vision of helping every person rise.

We recognize that personal experience informs our perspective and, ultimately, our point of view. Those experiences are influenced by our color, race, religion, religious creed, sex, gender or gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, national origin, citizenship, ethnicity, ancestry, age, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, pregnancy (including medical needs which may arise from pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), military and veteran status, genetic information, marital or familial status, political affiliation, and so much more. Our community provides both the room to be yourself and the support to grow and make a positive difference with your career. This approach offers our team a fulfilling workplace and a diverse professional peer group dedicated to making our country a better place.

We don’t go through the motions of inclusion. We live it, every day. Each employee is accountable for embodying and fostering the values of inclusion, dignity, respect, and humility. At Stand Together everyone is a diversity officer. We are committed to listening and learning how to ensure our workplace and communities are places for open and respectful discussions that can advance meaningful change. Our values are not just words on paper, they are what we live by and hold each other accountable to, every day.

Because every individual has extraordinary gifts, we believe that together we can transform how we tackle our nation’s greatest challenges to help every person rise.

Lil Wayne made it to no.7 on the list…but Birdman was nowhere on the list. In the comments section, Brinmand’s followers mostly agreed with his comments.

Birdman isn’t the only rapper to complain about the list. Melle Mel has complained about the list and several other rappers felt they should have been higher up.

Australia Working Holiday Visa: Working in Australia – Requirements

March 10, 2023 March 8, 2023 by Braelynn Murphy

If you’re looking for a way to travel and work in Australia, then the Working Holiday Visa might be the perfect option for you. It allows you to travel and work in Australia for up to 12 months, and potentially extend it for an additional 12 months. This article will provide you with all the information you need to know including the application process, requirements, job opportunities, and more.

Visa Bureau is not affiliated with the Australian Government but is an independent UK company.

Applying for an Australian Working Holiday Visa

Also known as the WHM Visa, gives young people between the ages of 18 and 30 (35 for Canadian and Irish Citizens) the opportunity to enjoy working holidays (i.e. an extended stay supplemented by working in Australia) for up to 24 months.

Visas for Working Holidays can now be applied for online. To confirm your eligibility, complete an online assessment.

What are the conditions?

The scheme gives Working Holiday Visa holders casual work rights in order to supplement their travels. Work undertaken must be incidental to the main purpose of holidaying and employment for more than 6 months with any one employer is not allowed. The application must be made offshore (i.e. not in Australia).

Basic Requirements

You must be between 18 and 30 years old (or 35 if you are a Canadian or Irish citizen).

You must have a valid passport with at least 6 months until renewal.

You must have sufficient funds to support yourself when you arrive in Australia.

Have health insurance for the duration of your stay in Australia

Meet the English language requirements

Meet the character requirements

Have no dependent children

Health and Character Requirements

You must not have any substantial criminal convictions.

You must not have any substantial medical issues.

For more information on the basic requirements, please choose the relevant pages, including frequently asked questions.

How can a Working Holiday Visa be extended?

The Government will allow Working Holiday Visa holders the opportunity to apply for a second Working Holiday Visa provided they have worked as a specified worker in regional Australia for 3 months.

\liday Visa holders working in Australia in several primary industries, including plant/animal cultivation, fishing, tree farming, mining and construction work, will be defined as ‘specified workers’ and be eligible to apply for a second one, thus extending their trip from 12 months to 24. Applications for a second visa can be made both offshore and onshore in Australia.

Need help deciding which visa you need?

Still, confused about which travel visa you require for your trip to Australia? Use our fast, easy online travel visa advisor to find out exactly which visas you are eligible for when traveling to Australia.

Work and Holiday Visa (subclass 462)

Travelers from the United States should note that while they are not eligible for the Australian Working Holiday Visa, they can instead apply for the Australian Work and Holiday Visa (subclass 462).

The Australian Work and Holiday Visa is very similar to the Australian Working Holiday Visa in many ways but is open to several other countries. However, the Australian Visa Bureau only handles Work and Holiday Visa applications from United States passport holders.

Finding a Job in Australia

Moving to Australia and finding a job can be challenging, but there are plenty of opportunities available. Some popular job options include hospitality, farming, and retail. There are also many job search websites and recruitment agencies that specialize in helping holders find work in Australia.

Taxes and Superannuation

You will be required to pay taxes on any income you earn in Australia. The Australian tax system can be complicated, so it’s important to understand your obligations and seek advice if necessary. You will also be eligible for the superannuation system, which is a form of retirement savings that employers are required to contribute to on behalf of their employees.

Healthcare and Insurance

All holders are required to have health insurance for the duration of their stay in Australia. The Australian healthcare system is excellent, but it can be expensive for visitors without insurance. It’s important to have comprehensive insurance that covers you for any accidents or illnesses that may occur during your stay in Australia.

Accommodation

Finding affordable accommodation in Australia can be challenging, especially in popular cities like Sydney and Melbourne. Some popular options for Working Holiday Visa holders include hostels, shared apartments, and homestays. It’s important to research your options and book accommodation in advance, especially during peak travel seasons.

Transportation

Australia is a vast country, and getting around can be challenging without a car. However, there are many public transportation options available, including buses, trains, and trams. Many cities also have bike-sharing schemes, which can be a convenient and eco-friendly way to get around.

Tips for Traveling and Working

Traveling and working in Australia can be a fantastic experience, but it’s important to be prepared. Here are some tips to help you make the most of your Working Holiday Visa experience:

Save money before you arrive to ensure you have enough funds to support yourself during your stay.

Research job opportunities and potential employers before you arrive to make the job search process easier.

Take advantage of the many free and low-cost activities available, such as hiking, beach visits, and visiting national parks.

Be open-minded and willing to try new things, whether it’s trying new foods or participating in cultural events.

Stay connected with other Working Holiday Visa holders and locals to make the most of your time in Australia.

Making the Most of Your Visa Experience

The Working Holiday Visa is a fantastic opportunity to travel and work in Australia, but it’s important to make the most of your experience. Here are some tips to help you do just that:

Take advantage of the many opportunities available to meet new people and make friends.

Travel to different parts of Australia to experience the country’s diverse landscapes and cultures.

Participate in cultural events and festivals to learn more about Australia’s history and traditions.

Volunteer your time and skills to give back to the local community.

Keep a journal or blog to document your experiences and reflect on your journey.

Common Issues and Solutions

Working and traveling in a foreign country can come with its fair share of challenges. Here are some common issues and solutions for Working Holiday Visa holders:

Difficulty finding work: Research job opportunities before you arrive, and be willing to take on temporary or casual work to build your resume.

Homesickness: Stay connected with friends and family back home, and make an effort to meet new people in Australia.

Culture shock: Be open-minded and willing to learn about Australian culture, and don’t be afraid to ask for help if you’re feeling overwhelmed.

Language barriers: Practice your English skills before you arrive, and make an effort to communicate with locals to improve your language proficiency.

Be sure to check the skilled occupation list of skilled occupations that are in demand in Australia. It is designed to help the Australian government to identify and attract skilled workers to meet the needs of the Australian economy.

Extending Your Visa

If you’re enjoying your time in Australia and want to extend your stay, you may be eligible to apply for a second Working Holiday Visa. To be eligible, you must have completed at least three months of specified work in a regional area of Australia while on your first Working Holiday Visa.

Returning Home After Your Experience

Returning home after your Working Holiday Visa experience can be a challenging transition. Here are some tips to help you readjust:

Stay in touch with the friends you made in Australia.

Reflect on your experiences and what you learned during your time in Australia.

Stay connected with the Australian culture by following Australian news and events.

Use your experiences to enhance your personal and professional growth.

ArmadaCare Introduces HealthPro Product Suite for Healthcare Employers Facing Talent Shortages and Turnover

Press Release • April 7, 2020

Hunt Valley, Maryland— In response to the healthcare industry’s growing need for innovative benefits to support talent retention and recruitment, ArmadaCare has launched a suite of supplemental expense reimbursed insurance plans. HealthPro Ultimate, HealthPro Advanced and HealthPro Launch are employer-paid health insurance products specially designed to address the high turnover challenges faced by hospital systems, skilled nursing facilities and other healthcare organizations.

Each product is a fully insured reimbursement plan that supplements the employer’s primary plan and allows strategic boosting of coverage for positions effected by talent shortages and/or high turnover. ArmadaCare’s products are qualified excepted benefits – meaning they’re exempt from ACA reforms – and can be offered to select employee classes. By leveraging the tax-deductible employer premiums and non-taxable* employee reimbursements, these solutions are a financially efficient way to provide additional compensation value and retain talent.

HealthPro Ultimate , our premier product in this suite, is designed with physicians, executives and administrators in mind. Robust supplemental medical, dental and vision coverage, coupled with enhanced mental health and wellness coverages help to address the daily pressures faced by this employee class. In addition, our TimeSaver Plus work-life balance services can help ease the stress of those demands and reduce the negative impacts of burnout.

HealthPro Advanced is designed to support mid-career nurses, advanced practitioners and allied health professionals. Recognizing the needs of young families, HealthPro Advanced includes insurance coverage for various types of medical, dental and vision expenses, including orthodontia. It also incorporates TimeSaver services to support busy family life.

HealthPro Launch is designed for recent graduates who’ve just begun their careers in the healthcare industry. With mental health, dental, vision and wellness benefits, this insurance product caters to the needs of younger generations new to the workforce.

Add-On In-System Package for Hospital Clients

ArmadaCare recognizes that many hospital systems want to promote the use of in-system medical services. To support that effort, we’ve developed optional add-on package for these three products. The basic package of services helps to coordinate reimbursement levels depending on network tier (in-system, in-network and out-of-network). We can also encourage in-hospital pharmacy use to support 340-B programs, as well as help navigate to in-hospital specialists through our Specialty Care Connect services.

The HealthPro product suite is available in 35 states.

*This is not local, state or federal tax advice as each person and company is unique. It is recommended that you seek the independent counsel of a professional tax adviser.

ArmadaCare’s products are qualified excepted benefits – meaning they’re exempt from ACA reforms – and can be offered to select employee classes. By leveraging the tax-deductible employer premiums and non-taxable* employee reimbursements, these solutions are a financially efficient way to provide additional compensation value and retain talent.

HealthPro Ultimate , our premier product in this suite, is designed with physicians, executives and administrators in mind. Robust supplemental medical, dental and vision coverage, coupled with enhanced mental health and wellness coverages help to address the daily pressures faced by this employee class. In addition, our TimeSaver Plus work-life balance services can help ease the stress of those demands and reduce the negative impacts of burnout.

HealthPro Advanced is designed to support mid-career nurses, advanced practitioners and allied health professionals. Recognizing the needs of young families, HealthPro Advanced includes insurance coverage for various types of medical, dental and vision expenses, including orthodontia. It also incorporates TimeSaver services to support busy family life.

HealthPro Launch is designed for recent graduates who’ve just begun their careers in the healthcare industry. With mental health, dental, vision and wellness benefits, this insurance product caters to the needs of younger generations new to the workforce.

ArmadaCare recognizes that many hospital systems want to promote the use of in-system medical services. To support that effort, we’ve developed optional add-on package for these three products. The basic package of services helps to coordinate reimbursement levels depending on network tier (in-system, in-network and out-of-network). We can also encourage in-hospital pharmacy use to support 340-B programs, as well as help navigate to in-hospital specialists through our Specialty Care Connect services.

The HealthPro product suite is available in 35 states.

Brown Marble - Types and Uses of Marble

Published on September 22, 2022 . September 22, 2022 0

Purchasing a house requires adequate knowledge about investments, amenities, and property value, but making that house you just purchased a ""home"" needs much more than that. Designing a home is an amalgamation of emotions, efforts, and a passion for your design, for homeowners today! We are all aware that imported marble application is one of the quintessential points of consideration while making an interior design plan. Marble stone is a timeless beauty adored for its impeccable durability, aesthetically eye-pleasing appearance, and its ability to be heat-resistant. Architects and interior designers consider the area of application, budget, purpose, and sense of style before suggesting a marble stone installation in the space.

While white marble stone is the sought-after piece most trusted by homeowners in general, owing to its timeless beauty and durability that lasts for generations. Individuals with high fashion taste and their urge to feel closer to nature these days are more inclined towards creating a state-of-the-art kind of residence. The desire to create a masterpiece residence inspired by nature brings them closer to investing in incredible beauties such as Irish Brown Marble or Brown Onyx Marble such as Vatican Tra Onyx by R K Marble.

Top Brown Marble for in-vogue design

Adorned in some of the most luxurious homes, a brown marble stone exudes elegance, extravagance, and delight all at once. If you have a modish taste in fashion, designing a nature-inspired home with brown marble texture and golden brown marble flooring would be among your first picks for the dream home. The vast chromatic spectrum of earth tones may be found in the many types of brown marble. Its lovely brown hues evoke peace and relaxation in opulent settings and reconnect our emotions with nature.

The dark brown marble is covered in a stunning gold lattice, giving the rooms a luxurious feel. The Dark Emperador is a fantastic choice for a kitchen countertop. By combining this stone with grey or white cabinetry, you can enhance the appearance of this busy space like a pro!

3. The Cafe Amaro

The Cafe Amaro marble, a distinctive hue of coffee and crème, is a masterpiece of nature for your interior space. This light brown marble looks incredibly breathtaking as a living room floor when paired with dark brown or grey furniture and accent pieces in gold, silver, or rose gold.

4. The Royal Vendome

Grand Seiko Collector's Guide

GRAND SEIKO THE WORLD’S BEST

The original Grand Seiko watch and the line of watches that followed would be a game-changer for the Japanese watchmaker. The Grand Seiko range would prove that Seiko was capable of producing quality watches that could compete with and even exceed those produced by Swiss watch manufacturers.

Before the introduction of Grand Seiko, high-end watch consumers did not think highly of the company despite Seiko producing quality watches and bagging awards.[1] The Seiko Crown and Chronos movements both were at the peak of Japanese technology, but the Grand Seiko turned it from an inferior watch manufacturer to a major player in the luxury watch market.

The “grand” moniker would be significant for this change. It mirrored the company’s goal of creating “the best luxury watch in the world.” In 1960, the company’s Suwa division was tasked to create the best watch it could possibly make at that time.[1]

GRAND SEIKO AT THE OLYMPICS

The timing of the Grand Seiko’s introduction to the market also proved crucial to its success. The Grand Seiko Chronometer Cal. 5722 was introduced in 1964, the year Tokyo hosted the 18th Olympiad.[2]

Seiko served as the event’s official timer. The company brought simple countdown chronographs with Cal 5718A movements and mono-pusher chronographs with Cal 5717 and Cal 5719 movements.[3]

Because of its successful participation at the Olympics, Seiko finally gained international respect and credibility.

VYING FOR HIGHEST ACCURACY

The 1964 Olympic Games was only the beginning of Seiko’s quest to leave a permanent mark on the high-end watch market. The company entered the Grand Seiko into the Neuchatel chronometer testing from the year the watch was released until the trials ended.[1] The Neuchatel observatory rated and ranked the movements that it tested, making it possible to see which ones were most accurate.

When Seiko first joined the international competition, it placed 144th. Three years later, in 1967, Seiko moved into the top 10. When the testing stopped in 1968, Seiko was running for first place. Rumor has it the testing ended so Neuchatel could avoid declaring Seiko as the winner in the Swiss chronometer competition. [1]

Undeterred, Seiko joined the equivalent Geneva competition in its quest to win first place. This time around, it wasn’t disappointed. Its Grand Seiko watches ranked 4th to 10th places, making the line’s movements among the most accurate in the world.[1]

GRAND SEIKO PRODUCTION

Production of the Grand Seiko line ran for 12 years. The first Grand Seiko was produced on December 18th 1960 while the last one was made in 1972.[4]

The Suwa Seikosha division produced most of the Grand Seiko watches, except for the 44GS, 45GS, and 45GS VFA movements, which were created by its Daini Seikosha division. The two companies were Seiko’s subsidiaries which produced one brand to improve technology and hedge risk amid tough competition. If one experienced problems in production, the other would simply increase production. Suwa Seikosha became Seiko Epson Corporation, while Daini Seikosha became Seiko Instruments Inc.[5]

Seiko started manufacturing its first-generation Grand Seiko 3180 model in December 1960 at the company’s Suwa factory in Nagano prefecture in central Japan.[4] A total of 36,000 units of the first generation watch were created.

The 57GS movement followed in 1963 with 81,000 units manufactured.[5]

Afterwards, Seiko produced the 44GS and 62GS movements. Released in December 1967, Seiko created 36,000 units of the 61GS line.[6] This was followed by the 45GS, 45GS VFA, 19GS, and 19GS VFA movements from 1968 toward 1970. Finally, Seiko released the last model in this line, a mechanical 56GS, in 1972. [4]

DESIGN

Seiko’s design concept for the Grand Seiko was to create the “ideal watch,” which meant “nothing less than the best luxury watch in the world.”[7, 8] For the company, this meant the Grand Seiko should have its own unique style that would resonate with the high-end market. Specifically, Seiko wanted the Grand Seiko’s style to suit both casual and formal attires.[9]

When the original Grand Seiko watch was created in 1960 by the company’s Suwa Seikosha division, its focus was on quality mechanics. [10] It wasn’t until 1967 when the 44GS movement was released that the “Grand Seiko Style” by designer Taro Tanaka would from then on define the style of the series as well as all future Seiko products.[10]

The Grand Seiko range is also highly valued for its craftsmanship, particularly the traditional way in which the watches are created.[11] Every Grand Seiko watch was polished by hand using the“Zaratsu” technique. This is a traditional way of polishing that Japanese watchmakers use to create watches that have a mirror finish with no distortion. [9, 12]

CLASSICS REVIVED IN LIMITED EDITIONS

The 1967 44GS movement, or “The Grammar of Design”, was so iconic that in 2013, Seiko released a limited edition watch based on it, the Grand Seiko 44GS. The replica or remake was powered by a manual 9S64 movement that closely mimics the original.[3] The limited-edition model had two variants, one was the same as the original (700 units stainless steel) and the other came in white, yellow, and rose gold (70 units each).[13]

The Grand Seiko Historical Collection 62GS was another classic revival. The collection included four limited editions: stainless steel with 600 units produced and three gold variants – yellow gold, rose gold, and white gold – with 100 units each.[14]

The original Grand Seiko 3180 was produced in replica, model number SBGW033, and 1300 units were produced.

VARIATIONS

Although “Grand Seiko” is the name given to the entire range, it could also refer to the original Cal. 3180 model when speaking of particular variations within the range.

THE FIRST GRAND SEIKO

THE 3180 MODEL

L to R: Seiko’s first GS, the 3180; Cal. 3180 movement; an early GS with carved characters on the dial; GS 3180 back case with the lion logo

The 3180 model was based on the “Crown” movement, which featured 25 functional jewels at 18,000 bph and was hand wound.[18] It was the first chronometer grade watch manufactured in Japan and was based on an internal Seiko standard and certification. As such, it had the “Chronometer” label on the dial and a lion logo on the case back. The model number was J14070.

The initial accuracy rate of the 3180 model and the first Grand Seiko standard (-3 to +12 sec/day) was that of the Basel Observatory Chronometer standard at the time, and when this was changed to -1 to +10 sec/day in 1961, the second Grand Seiko standard changed to a slightly different 11 second range (-3 to +8 sec/day). [53,54]

Most of the cases were made from 18k gold-plated (80 microns), although platinum cases were also produced.[5, 52] Rarely, stainless steel cases existed, with the lion symbol on the case back, but with chronometer under, rather than Grand Seiko above.[51,56] It had a snap-type back lid and was non-waterproof. The crown of this model was coarse knurled.

This below is a relatively rare first model 3180 with a carved dial.

The initial characters on the dial were either printed black or the carved characters as in the image above. This was later changed in 1961 to applied characters in relief as engraving was error-prone and inconsistent. This is the most commonly found dial.[50]

The case back featured an embossed lion with the words Grand Seiko, and the i nside case back was engraved 14K Gold Filled J14070 GS.

Above is a Stainless Steel model [56]

Inside case back was engraved Stainless Steel J14070 GS.

THE 57GS MODEL

The 57GS “Self-Dater” variations (from left to right): 5722-9990 with AD Logo, 5722-9990 without AD logo, 5722-9991 also known as the “Calendar Model”, and 5722-9011 in gold

The 57GS “Self-Dater” introduced in 1963 was the only other model that featured “Chronometer” on the dial. After its introduction, Seiko stopped using the label and started implementing the Grand Seiko Standard.[23]

A timeline diagram will show the overlap between models, with an overlap in production between all models.

The 57GS “Self-Dater” was so called because it had a quick set date mechanism. It was the first watch to use a date complication.[3]

The 57GS had four variations: 5722-9990, 5722-9010, 5722-9011, and 5722-9991. The most common variations are the 5722-9990 and the 5722-9991 models which succeed one another. The 5722-9010 and 5722-9011 are successive gold cap models.

The range’s first model, however, was the Grand Seiko Taiyo 43999 with the 430 movement. The watch features a matte pearl silver sunburst dial, steel baton markers, and steel dauphine hands. The model also has a distinct aperture for the date – a silver steel window frame – at the 3 o’clock mark.[45]

Sunburst dial, and AD symbol

The crown is coarse knurled, although this changed to fine knurled later in the production run. The image above (and first image on the header) shows a three-pointed star inside a triangle, which is the Applique Dial (AD) symbol. It indicates that Seiko used an applique for the logo rather than printing it on the dial, a technique which wasn’t exclusive to Grand Seiko watches.[45]

Earlier models had the SD symbol, overlapping 4 pointed stars, which indicated a Special dial with gold hour markers.

Seiko 57GS’s 430 movement and case back with the lion medallion.

The 430 movement was a step up from the 3180 movement in the first Grand Seiko model.

All models of the 43999 have the Chronometer inscription on the dial and have the lion medallion on the case, a Seiko symbol of chronometer grade.

As can be seen above, the Cal. 430 movement 43999 was cased in a heavily lugged stainless steel case with threaded case back and is waterproof to 50 meters.

As the Cal. 430-43999 model was phased out it overlapped with the Cal. 5722 model. The 5722A was the first generation of 5722 which was produced in 1965. The movement operated at 19800 bph. The watch featured the Chronometer label on the dial, while the 5722B had a fine-knurled crown. Both featured the “W SEIKO” imprint on their crowns.[45]

Later in the production run, when the word “Chronometer” was removed from the dial, the case back also changed. The lion medallion was removed, and the case just featured GS. This did not necessarily mean the Grand Seiko model but that the Grand Seiko Standard of movement had been utilised. There is overlap between the dials with and without Chronometer, and case backs with and without the lion medallion or GS medallion.

Later versions of 5722 did not retain the Chronometer dial legend due to the lack of independent Commission Internationale des Controles Chronometriaues (CICC) certification facilities in Japan. The model initially used the second Grand Seiko standard of -3 to +8 sec/day introduced in 1961 [53].

By 1966, the GS Standard was implemented on all Grand Seiko watches, setting a higher level of precision and reliability than any yet achieved by Seiko and even higher than the International Chronometer standards.

Today, the Grand Seiko standard remains higher than today’s chronometer standards involving more tests in more positions and more temperatures.

The model is more commonly called the 5722-9990 model (pictured above – 2nd image) and can have a coarse knurled crown or fine knurled crown. It mostly has a lion medallion case back.

This 5722-9990 model does not have the AD logo, and the movement was engraved 5722A. Both the 430 and 5722A movements were called “tadpole” movements.

A rare Toshiba 25th anniversary with 5722B movement, the lion medallion and a fine knurled crown. Model 5722-9970. Case back in Kanji with 1965. Later versions have GS on the dial, the GS medallion on the back, and 1968.

The 5722B model (third image on heading) generally dispenses with the word “Chronometer” and is known as the Calendar model. The model number is 5722-9991. The caseback is the GS medallion. It had GS Standard official approval and operated at 19,800 bph. It also featured coarse knurled and fine knurled crowns.

This has rack and pinion regulation, not tadpole regulation.

The 5722-9010 model was a gold cap version of the 5722-9991. This model is rare and the case back reads GC.

The 5722-9010 gold cap model with the lion medallion back

The 5722-9010 pictured above was a more heavily gold plated model. The variant below is another gold cap version with white dial and gold markings. This has the GS back and reads CAP GOLD.

THE 44GS MODEL

King Seiko Chronometer (4420A) 44GS Grand Seiko (4420B) and the 4420 – 9990 Gold Cap. The Gold Cap model remains similar to the 57 GS series.

Daini Seikosha released the 44GS in 1964 as a King Seiko Chronometer initially, but because of its appeal and growing reputation as an accurate chronometer in 1966, it became the 44GS Grand Seiko.

Taro Tanaka, Seiko’s first hired graduate of a College Design Program came up with design rules which eventually came to be known as the “Grammar of Design” at Seiko. He wanted Seiko watches to sparkle brilliantly when on display and without any distortions.

The rules were:

Perfectly flat surfaces and angles for cases, dials, hands, indexes

Two Dimensional faceted curves for the bezel

All distortion should be eliminated from the dial, hands, indexes and case, the finishing of the dial and case should be a mirror finish so it shines and sparkles

No more round cases, a unique case design

Only Grand and King Seiko watches benefited from this design as the new case design required very expensive and labour intensive polishing and finishing. This is what makes the 44GS so special along with it being the first Grand Seiko made by the Daini factory and the first time the GS logo appeared at 6 on the dial.

The first models had DIASHOCK on the dial, and did not have the Daini logo.

Later models just had the Daini logo.

The difference in Movement between 44GS Grand Seiko (4420B) and the King Seiko Chronometer (4420A) is the control device for the second hand. The case design was changed to emphasize the beauty of a straight line. This formed the basis of later models, 45GS and 61GS.

Production was limited and models are rare.

The back lid is a screwback type and it guaranteed 50 m depth waterproof.

Short lug or pillowcase style and only stainless steel models of this type were produced. No date facility.

THE 62GS MODEL

The 62GS and its four variations (from left to right): 6245 – 9000 and 6245 – 9001 both with day complications; 6246 – 9000 and 6246 – 9001 with day/date complications

By early 1966, the Grand Seiko line would have two manual-wound chronometers, the Self-Date 5722 and the no-date 44GS as seen above. With the Japanese’s exclusion from eligibility for a COSC (Contrôle Officiel Suisse des Chronomètres) certification, Seiko would, later on, have to rebrand this model that would become the 62GS.

This Grand Seiko model was originally called the Seikomatic Chronometer and housed an automatic movement, the calibre 6200, introduced in 1966. Seiko was forced to drop the word “chronometer” as a result of the Swiss COSC’s appeal to the watch manufacturer’s self-certification of chronometer ratings. These Seikomatic Chronometer models were the 6245 – 9000 model which is pictured above on the left with a day complication and the 6246 – 9000 model which is day/date.

These had Chronometer and Seikomatic Diashock 35 Jewels on the dial and Chronometer 35 Jewels engraved on the movement rotor.

Both of the Seikomatic chronometers had a back case reading Seiko within a lion medallion, and these models are commonly referred to as Lion Medallion models to distinguish them from the 62GS.

The rebranded Seikomatic Chronometers were then launched in July 1966 as the 62GS and came in two models: the 6245-9001 and the 6246-9001.

The 6245-9001 had a 35 jewel automatic movement and featured a date complication while the 6246-9001 had 39 jewels with both date and day complications. Both models oscillated at 19,800 bph. In terms of design, these new models were considered to be on the high-end side with its bezel-free case construction, a mirrored, multi-faceted case, and Grand Seiko’s highly-regarded “Zaratsu” polishing. It is distinguished by a flush-mounted crown at 4 and a contoured case. The crown position was at 4 and “hidden” to emphasise that the watch was automatic and did not need a winding crown.

This is the 6245 – 9001 model with a faceted case

This line had four variations: 6245-9000, 6245-9001, 6246-9000, and 6246-9001. The models 6245-9000 and 6246-9000 are not Grand Seiko models, but are closely related, and are known as Lion Medallion models.

The 6245 – 9001 dispenses with Chronometer and Seikomatic and has GS and Grand Seiko badging.

The engraving Chronometer has been removed from the rotor.

The 6245 -9001 has the GS caseback but some lion case backs may exist as part of the transition from the 9000 model.

The 6246 – 9000 model (see the third image on the header) is again branded Chronometer and for this model, Seikomatic was written in script. Also, the word “Chronometer” is inscribed in its rotor. The model has the lion medallion caseback.

This has Chronometer on the rotor.

The 6246 – 9001(pictured above, fourth image) has GS and Grand Seiko badging, but some models carry the lion medallion on the back, despite the dial clearly being Grand Seiko.

A gold cap model below with GOLD CAP and the GS medallion on the case back.

THE 61GS MODEL

Seiko 61GS basic models: 1) 6145A, 2) 6146A, 3) 6185A, 4)6155A, 5) 6156A, 6) 6185B, and 7) 6186B

Another line of automatic watches, the 61GS family, featured higher alterations and were called “Automatic Hi-Beat.” These watches came out in the late 1960s and had the Seiko 6100 movement at 21,000 bph. The 61GS has 20 variations: 6145-8000, 6145-8020, 6145-8050, 6146-8000, 6146-8010, 6146-8020, 6146-8030, 6146-8040, 6146-8050, 6185-8010, 6185-8020, 6185-8021, 6185-7000, 6155-8000, 6156-8000, 6156-8001, 6156-8010, 6156-8020, 6156-8040, and 6186-8000.

V.F.A (Very Fine Adjusted) models boasted accuracy of one minute per month for the first two years of ownership

There were 36,000 watches produced for these two models, in line with the 36,000 bph engineering in the movement.

The seven basic 61GS models were as follows:

6145A (1968-1970) – GS standard official approval, date only 6146A (1968-1970) – GS standard official approval, day/date

Ordinary 61GS models have a 4 in the third digit, and are 614x movements, regulated to the Grand Seiko standard of -3/+5 sec/day.

6155A (1970-1973) – GS Special standard official approval, date only 6156A (1970-1973) – GS Special standard official approval, day/date

The Special 61GS models, have a 5 in the third digit, utilising either the 6155A or 6156A movements, and were introduced in late 1970 for a 10,000 Yen premium. These movements were regulated to the Grand Seiko Special standard of -/+3 sec/day. Special features on the dial.

6185A (1969-1972) – V.F.A., date only 6185B (circa 1972-1975) – V.F.A., date only 6186B (1972-1975) – V.F.A., day/date

The VFA (Very Fine Adjusted) movements have an 8 in the third digit and achieve -/+2 sec/day accuracy.

The movement is one of Seikos finest, a 25 jewel automatic hi-beat that operates at 36,000bph, made at their Suwa factory. It can also be wound manually and has a hacking feature. It is finished to a high level, with a nicely decorated rotor. The 61GS movement achieved the Seiko internal GS standard approval, which was adjusted to be within -3/+5 sec/day when it left the factory. The Special standard watches, on the other hand, achieved -/+ 3 sec/day. It is based on the 61 SeikoMatic 5 movement and was engineered with technology developed from data from the Astronomical Observatory Concours competitions that Seiko did extremely well in during the late 1960s.

6145-8000

The early 6145-8000 model had Grand Seiko written on the silver dial which was marked 8000TAD at 6 o’clock. The movement was marked 6154A and both GS (sometimes) and Grand Seiko on the rotor. There was a gold cap version of this model also. The chapter ring is dotted and is outside the indexes.

Later models had automatic under Seiko and also dispensed with Grand Seiko and had Hi Beat 36000 instead, and 8010TAD at the bottom of the dial. The rotor was marked Seiko.

The 6145 – 8000 was a date only model. The stainless steel model had 8010TAD on the dial and 8000 on the case.

6145 – 8000 versions, from left to right: Gold cap version which had 8010TAD on the dial and either STAINLESS STEEL or CAP GOLD and a medallion on the case; Gold plated version which had 8015TKT on the dial and 18K on the case back which was flat and had no medallion; and cross-patterned version with different raised index markers and 8030TAD on the dial. On this model the chapter ring is between the indexes with alternate long and short tick marks.

Another cross-patterned version of the 6145-8000

A grey dial version with 8040T on the dial and with baton hands and raised index markers and chapter ring inside the indexes, similar to the 6145-8020 model below was also produced.

6145-8020

The 6145 – 8020 was a pillowcase style with curious rectangular or baton hands. The case was similar to the Astron, but with a more rectangular style. (On December 25, 1969, Seiko marketed the world’s first quartz watch, the Seiko Quartz Astron).

Black and grey dial versions also were produced.

The case back has a medallion and is marked STAINLESS STEEL 6145-8020.

6145-8020 in different dial colours

6145-8030

An Astron type case model with hammered or bark 18K yellow gold and linen dial marked 8050TKT was also available in limited quantities. The case back is marked 18K 6145-8030, without a medallion. The dial is either silver or gold. Silver case models are rare.

6145-8050

The 6145 -8050 model had a hardened stainless steel folded case and had only the words Hi-beat on the dial, not the 36000 (bph). The case back is engraved STAINLESS STEEL 6145-8050 and features the GS medallion.

This was the only calibre 61 Grand Seiko to feature a green dial. The hardlex crystal could be faceted. Black and grey dial versions also were produced.

6146-8000

The 6146 – 8000 was the day-date version of the 6145 – 8000.

The early 6146-8000 model is similar to the corresponding 6145 – 8000 model and had Grand Seiko written on the silver dial which was marked 8000TAD at 6 o’clock.

Later models have Automatic, Hi-Beat and 36000 on the silver dial which reads 6146-8020TAD

Gold cap version above with GOLD CAP on the case back.

Below is the cross dial version, with different raised indexes, and the dial reads 8030TAD

6146 – 8010

The 6146-8010 has a sapphire faceted crystal, and “flower carvings” around the GS marking on the dial. The case came as gold, and stainless steel.

6146 – 8020

The 6146 – 8020 is shown below with rectangular case and was produced a variety of dials, including a tea-stained colour. Hands were baton-style on some models with raised indices, and line minute divisions on a chapter ring inside the indexes.

6146 – 8030

The 6146-8030 below is an Astron style golf ball dimpled or bark finish version with an 18K yellow gold case, and starlight dial. Silver cases with a gold finis bezel were also available.

6146 – 8040

The 6146 – 8040 has a polished stainless steel case and a rare starlight dial.

6146 – 8050

This model had a hard steel folded casing and faceted crystal and various dial colours. These models have different raised indexes, a chapter ring inside the indexes, more baton-like hands and do not carry the 36,000 on the dial, but do have hi-beat engraved. The case is shared with the VFA model.

6146-8050 and its dial colour variations (White, black, and blue)

6185 – 8010

VFA movement. These models were put together by master watchmakers using selected parts and were accurate to +/- 2 sec/day.

Considered the best 61GS, the V.F.A. model had a Mean Monthly rate of +/- 60 seconds over the first two years. This translates to an accuracy of +/-2 sec/day compared to an ordinary 61GS at -3/+6 sec/day.

Characteristic of this model is: no VFA on the dial, a palladium case (hammered finish), no GS on the case back and thin pencil hands.

6185-8020

6185-8020 (pictured above): The first model has VFA on the dial, thin indexes and long thin hands. The second model has high raised indexes, and shorter hands as the hands are level with the indexes. Maybe this represents the transition to the 6185B movement from the 6185A movement, but both movements are used in this model, and VFA appears on the earlier model dials. Also shown in the image above is the watch’s VFA movement which is red gold plated.

6185 – 8021

The hard stainless steel model, with raised indexes and 6185B movement.

6185 – 7000

A 18K VFA gold model, with champagne or cream linen cloth finish to the dial. Thin indexes and long hands. Marking on the dial is 7000TKT, and the caseback has no medallion.

6155 – 8000

Rated accurate to +/- 3 sec/day, and has “Special” written in gold on the dial. The 6155 is a day model, with the 6155A movement.

It has thin elongated bar indices and thin hands like VFA model above, which makes this a very elegant watch.

6156 – 8000

The 6156-8000 is the day/date version of the 6155-8000

6156 – 8001

6156 – 8010

The 6156-8010 SPECIAL is made of HSS (Hard Stainless Steel) and has a 3 sided faceted sapphire crystal as shown in the images below:

6156 – 8020

This was a GOLD CAP version marked SPECIAL in gold.

6156 – 8040

No lugged case, with a brushed finish. Medallion case back.

6186-8000

This model had the 6186B movement and is very rare selling for $10,000 to $20,000.

The feature of the watch, apart from the movement, is the deeply recessed dial, with tall indices.

The watch also features highly distinctive dial, markers, hands and case. The tall dark slate grey applied markers stand tall. To make room for these high markers, the hour, minute and seconds hands are kept short – rather than float over the markers, they pass short of them. The dial is a fine sunburst silver.

THE 45GS MODEL

Another line with the “Hi-Beat” branding followed the 61GS line featured the hand-wound Seiko 4500 movement. The late 1960’s manual timepieces had improved to 36,000 bph and thus were called “Manual Hi-Beat”. Eleven variations are included in this line: 4520-7000, 4520-7010, 4520-8000, 4520-8010, 4520-8020, 4522-7000, 4522-7010, 4522-8000, 4522-8010, 4580-7000, and 4580-7010. The 4520-8020 is the only watch in the series to be Astronomical Observatory Chronometer Officially Certified.

The 45GS is one of the Grand Seiko models that housed the movement developed by Daini Seikosha at the astronomical observatory Concours. The other GS models that benefited from the technology were the King Seiko Chronometer and the King Seiko.

In 1968, Daini Sheikosha submitted 103 entries of its cal. 4520 to the Neuchâtel Observatory for chronometer certification. Swiss observatory chronometry trials were considered important and prestigious events in the watch industry at that time. These high beat movements ran at 36,000 bph as with the other prize-winning chronometers. Of these 103 watches, 73 passed as observatory chronometer-certified and the 4520-8020 is one of these 73.

In 1969 and 1970, a further 180 cal. 4580 movements were submitted and 153 passed as observatory chronometer certified.

All 226 certified models were made available to the public.[55]

The calibre variants were:

4500 KS 4502 KS 4520A – GS standard official approval, No date 4522A – GS standard official approval, Date 4580 – V.F.A., Date 4520A – Astronomical Observatory Chronometer official approval, No date

4520 – 7000

The first model in the series is the 4520 – 7000.

The 4520A series did not have a date, and this model had a “folded” case.

It came in both Gold Cap and stainless steel with navy, and white linen look dials.

The stainless steel model is shown below.

Other variants include navy – dialled versions and a gold-capped version with linen dial.

4520 – 7010

This is again the no date 4520A movement in a more oval shaped, rounded case, with a brushed finish. The dial was either plain or had 36000 on the dial.

4520 – 8000

Short lugged steel case following the grammar of design, which also came in Gold Cap.

4520 – 8010

Unique linen case 18 k pure gold model with a white dial.

This model is shown on the right below.

4522 – 7000

The next model in the 45GS date series is the 4522 – 7000

The 4522A calibre models had a date complication.

This came in stainless steel and gold cap with a variety of dials, white satin, black, and a cream linen look.

The case was a turtle shape with a “fold” at the lugs.

Grand Seiko 4522A (from left to right): Stainless steel cap variant, Gold cap version with linen dial, Stainless steel cap version with black dial

Stainless model with linen dial

4522 – 7010

This has a more rounded brushed steel case and is a rarer model.

It was called the “Linear Beauty”, and has very thin hands.

It was the first GS with sapphire glass, and like the 4520-7010 model was either with, or without, 36000 0n the dial.

4522 – 8000

A more traditional short lugged case, as for the 4520-8000 version.

4522-8000 in stainless steel and gold cap versions. A comemmorative Toshiba employee model was made and is rarely found.

4522 – 8010

This model has a linen surface in 18K yellow gold, with a white dial.

The case is the same as that used in the legendary 4520-8020 Astronomical Observatory Chronometer (“AOC”), below.

4520 – 8020

This is a Chronometer certified model with a silver linen woven dial. Very rare as only 123 were produced. Many of those which passed the Neuchatel standard and then was sold to the public had daily deviation of +/- 0.175 sec/day[55].

4580 – 7000

The model is shown below on the right, with a 6185 VFA model on the left.

This model is an extremely rare VFA watch and very difficult to produce, and kept an accuracy of +/- 2 sec/day and +/- 60 sec/month for 2 years. Between 1969 and 1970 Seiko sold only 153 Cal 4580 watches as 4580-7000 or 4580-7010.[55}

THE 19GS MODEL

Another line of GS watches, the 19GS, is dubbed as the “Grand Seiko for Women”. Produced in the late 1960s to the early 1970s, the 19GS has three variations: Cal. 1984 VFA grade L4A, Cal. 1964 grade L3A, and Cal. 1944 grade L2A. The last 4 in the model number indicates no date.

The Cal 19 Hi-Beat was the first ladies size mechanical watch worldwide to run at 36,000 bph. It is shown below beside the Lord Marvel, the first Seiko watch to run at 36,000 bph.

The 1944 – 0012 model does not carry Grand Seiko and is sometimes dubbed a Queen Seiko.

1944 – 0020

This model was produced in 1969 and carries the CHRONOMETER designation, the first Japanese ladies model to do so.

1964 – 0010

This model has dauphine hands similar to the 62GS, and carries GS on the dial and caseback. Other models with pencil hands were produced.

1984 – 3000

Below is a ladies GS model found on the Grand Seiko website but without a model number, somewhat similar to the 6245 GS :

THE 56GS MODEL

Finally, the last line, 56GS, was often referred to as “Ultra Thin”. It includes 18 variations: 5641-5000, 5641-7005, 5641-7000, 5645-5000, 5645-7005, 5645-8000, 5645-5010, 5645-7000, 5645-7010, 5646-5010, 5646-7010, 5646-7000, 5646-7005, 5646-7011, 5646-7020, 5646-7030, 5646-7040, and 5646-8000.

Most of the 56GS production process was automated beginning in the 1970s. The precision level suffered as a result of this transition, with a decrease in movement speed from 36,000 bph to 28,800 bph. The reliability level, on the other hand, increased and some people even consider the 28,800 bph to be the best speed for a watch movement, with its balance of maintenance, reliability and precision. As these were mass produced, it is easy to get maintenance parts for the 56GS even now, 40 years after its production, making it the most reliable of all the Grand Seiko models produced in the past. A slightly less finely tuned calibre 56 movement was also used in King Seiko and Lordmatics.

MOVEMENTS OF GRAND SEIKO

Seiko started with a manual movement for the Grand Seiko before releasing the series first automatic watch. The series used both mechanical and quartz movements.[15] The Grand Seiko had a total of 22 movements.

The first Grand Seiko featured a hand-winding movement CAL. 3180 at 18,000 bph, 25 functional jewels, and a hairspring that was developed in-house.[16]

The hand-winding movement continued with the Self Dater line which has 35 jewels. The line featured two movements, CAL. 5722 A and 5722 B. The former is 18,000 bph based on Seiko’s internal chronometer declaration, while the latter is 19,800 bph with GS standard official approval.

In The Grammar of Design, Daini added a hand-winding movement, CAL. 4420 B, set at 18,000 bph. [3] The movement was also used for Daini’s first King Seiko.

The 62GS or Self Winding was the first Grand Seiko manual chronograph. It had two movements (CAL. 6245 A and 6246 A), 26 jewels, and was set at 18,000 bph.

The 6200 movement was replaced by the much-faster Automatic Hi-Beat (36,000 bph), featuring a self-winding Seiko 6100 movement (CAL. 6145 A, 6146 A, 6185 A, 6185 B, 6155 A, 6156 A, and 6186 B) which had a power reserve of 46 hours or almost two days. However, creating the movement entailed too much labor so the company mechanized it the following year. The movement was used again in the 1975 Seiko 6159A movement and 6159B for a 600m diver. [3]

The Seiko 4500 movement (CAL. 4522 A, 4580/VFA, 4520 A) that powered the 45GS line was created to replace Daini’s 4440. [3] It is also the same movement in King Seiko 45KS. [3]

The 19GS family had a hand-winding movement (CAL. 1984 VFA grade L4A, CAL. 1964 grade L3A, and CAL. 1944 grade L2A), but the 56GS line (CAL. 5641, 5645 A, and 5646 A) that followed featured a self-winding Seiko 5600 movement.

Finally, the last GS line 56GS (CAL. 5641 A, 5645 A, and 5646 A) had a self-winding Seiko 5600 movement that first appeared in the 1968 Lord Marvel. Backed with 47 hours of power reserve, it was the movement of other watches until 1976, including the King Seiko 56KS, Seiko Duotime, Seiko Chronometer, and Lord Matic timepieces. [3]

COMPLICATIONS

Some watches of the Grand Seiko series have complications, but the original GS launched with none. So did The Grammar of Design, the Grand Seiko for Women, Manual Hi-Beat CAL 4580/VFA and CAL. 4520, and the Ultra Thin CAL. 5641 A.

The first complication was introduced in the Self Dater line, with CAL. 5722A or “Taiyo”. The Self Daters, and the rest that followed featured a date indicator, except CAL. 6246 A, 6146 A, 6156 A, 6156 B, and 5646 A which had Day/Date indicators.

DIALS [17-40]

The many variations in the Grand Seiko series can be characterized by their dial colors, dial badge, stick markers[41], and case-back medallion, among other things. The series, however, lacks lume[42] and subdials[4].

DIAL COLORS

The original Grand Seiko CAL. 3180 came in two dial colors, plain white and silver sunburst. The latter is prominent from in the 57GS, 44GS, and 62GS lines.

Watch collectors should note that model 6145-8050 has a green dial color which is rare. Models 6146-8020 and 4522-7000 with a black dial, 6146-8040 with a starlight dial, and 6146-8050 with a blue dial are also rare specimens of this series.

HANDS

Grand Seiko watches consistently had dauphine hand style, but later on, Seiko added obelisque and index/fils. The latter two were introduced in the Automatic Hi-Beat GS watches and lasted until Seiko ended production of the vintage GS line.

Model 6146-8030 is also said to have gold-plated hands.

DIAL BADGE

The dial badge features a specific set of words and special logos, some of which are distinct to a specific line, movement, or model. Here are the highlights.

The “Grand Seiko” moniker can only be seen in the Grand Seiko CAL. 3180, in 62GS CAL. 6245 A, 61GS CAL. 6185 A and CAL. 6185 B, and in models 6186-8000, 4580-7000, and 5722-9990.

Meanwhile, the “Chronometer” marking is only sported by four models: Grand Seiko CAL. 3180, 5722-9990, and 6245-9000 and 6246-9000 in transition.

“Diashock” is featured in the dial badge of the first GS through the 62GS line.

The 61GS and the 56GS lines have the Suwa logo, while the 45GS line has the Daini logo. Also in the 61GS movement, Seiko started to use “Hi beat” on the dial, which signified that the watches had higher frequency of beats than the average watches available during that time.[14]

Manual Hi-Beat model 4520-8020 is the only watch in the entire series to have the inscription “Astronomical Observatory Chronometer Officially Certified” in its dial badge. The Daini logo and “Seiko” also appear in the watch’s face.

The entire 56GS line is characterized by a dial badge that has the Suwa logo and the words “Seiko,” “Automatic,” “GS,” and “Hi beat.”

CASES [17-40]

The Grand Seiko series cases measured 31-38mm x 40-44mm, excluding crown. They are screwback and have “water-resistance to 50m depth” or “water-proof” (44GS and 19GS) inscribed on them.

Seiko started out making the cases round, but introduced cushion in model 6145-8020. It also used tonneau in models 5641-5000 and 5645-5000, while models 5645-5010 and 5646-5010 had square cases.

MATERIAL

Seiko initially started using a stainless steel case for its watches and only added gold details later on. From the first Grand Seiko to the 62GS line, Seiko used a pure stainless steel case. It also used stainless steel for its 19GS and 19GS VFA.

Toward the end of the series’ production, Seiko started to feature gold cap or gold plating. A total of eight variations of the 61GS, 45GS, and 56GS families included either of these features, including 18-karat gold for models 6185-7000, 4520-8010, 4520-8020, 5641-5000, 5641-7005, 5645-5000, 5645-7005, and 5646-700. Three models, 6146-8000, 6156-8020, and 4520-7000, feature a gold cap. Meanwhile, 6145-8000 is available in gold and stainless steel.

CASE-BACK MEDALLION

The original Grand Seiko CAL. 3180 and the three models that followed (5722-9990, 5722-9010, and 5722-9011), as well as 6246-9000, all featured a lion emblem. Seiko used the emblem to denote “chronometer-grade.”[43]

All the rest featured “GS”, except CAL. 6185 A, CAL. 6185 B, CAL. 4580/VFA, and in models 4520-8010, 5641-5000, 5641-7005, 5645-5000, 5645-7005, 5645-5010, and 5646-7005.

GRAND SEIKO’S CROWN IMPRINT

Although most models were unsigned, a number of watches in the Grand Seiko range had crown imprints.

The original Grand Seiko CAL. 3180 had “S”, while the 57GS movement had “w seiko”. The 44GS, 61GS, and most of 45GS and 56GS movements had Original signed “GS”. Model 4520-7000 featured “G”, while models 4520-8020 and 5646-8000 were unsigned. Meanwhile, model 5645-5000 featured “GS” and the Japanese flag.

Also notable is the crown placement in model 6245-9000, which is set at 4 o’clock.

CRYSTAL AND BEZELS

Only three models have crystals and bezels in the entire Grand Seiko range. Both belong to the 61GS line. Two models, 6146-8030 and 6185-7000, sport gold-plated bezels. The former also features a plexi glass crystal instead of acrylic, which Seiko mainly used for its watch glass. Another model, 6146-8010, comes with a sapphire crystal.[44]

RECOMMENDATIONS

Watch collectors have to understand that the Grand Seiko range is a luxury line with only limited quantities produced. It is considered to be Seiko’s signature watch. As such, prices of these watches today typically run near or in the thousands of dollar range, depending on condition.[45,46]

START WITH

The Grand Seiko range is noted for its accurate movement. The least accurate among the GS watches has a higher rating than “almost every other brand’s best”,[11] which is great for collectors. Watch enthusiasts who want to start their own Grand Seiko collection can basically pick any of the many variations available. They would still end up with a very accurate watch.

However, for those unsure which model to pick, the original Grand Seiko (Cal. 3180) and the Hi-Beat watches (Cal. 6145A, 6146A, 6155A, 6156A, 5641A, 5645A, and 5646A) are great places to start.

SOMETHING DIFFERENT

Those looking for something more unique should go for those models with the rare dial colors, case-back medallion, shape, or crown imprint.

As a refresher, GS model 6145-8050, 6146-8020, 4522-7000, 6146-8040, and 6146-8050 all feature rare dial colors. Meanwhile, models 5722-9990, 5722-9010, 5722-9011, and 6246-9000 are the only Grand Seiko watches with the lion emblem. Model 5645-5000 is the only one to feature the Japanese flag in its crown imprint, while models 5641-5000 and 5645-5000 have tonneau cases and models 5645-5010 and 5646-5010 have square cases.

THE GRAIL

Those looking for the most valuable GS watch should look no further than “The Grammar of Design” (44GS Cal. 4420B). This is the model that’s most remembered when talking about the Grand Seiko line. The watch’s design is even called the “Grand Seiko Style”, and Tanaka’s design is so iconic that all Seiko products that were released afterward emulated it. This is a certified must-have for any watch collector.

In design, construction, finish and quality, the 61GS easily compares and stands tall with any of its contemporaries. While the Omega Constellation, Rolex Oyster Perpetual and Longines Flagship might garner more attention, the Grand Seikos are just as good in all aspects if not better. Vintage Grand Seikos represent an amazing value for a hi-end dress watch. Because they were not marketed to the US in the 1960s, they can be more difficult to find these days than their Swiss counterparts. That said, they can be had with patience and perseverance. A nice example of a 61GS can be found anywhere from $800 to $1500 depending on condition and seller/market. I know that many people dismiss the notion of a hi-end Seiko, but once you hold one of these in your hands, you can instantly recognize the inherent quality. They are a classy, well designed, engineered and executed watch, true high art horology.

Modern Grand Seiko

In 2011, to mark its 130 anniversary as a company, Seiko created a limited edition reissue of the first Grand Seiko model.

In 2013 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of its first wristwatch, Seiko remanufactured the 44GS model, the 44GS Historical Collection. The true reproduction, Grand Seiko SBGW047 is a limited edition of 700 pieces in stainless steel.

Daini Seikosha released the 44GS in 1964 as a King Seiko Chronometer initially, but because of its appeal and growing reputation as an accurate chronometer, in 1966 it became the 44GS Grand Seiko.

Taro Tanaka, designed the watch and his design rules eventually came to be known as the “Grammar of Design” at Seiko.

Only Grand and King Seiko watches benefited from this design as the new case design required very expensive and labour intensive polishing and finishing.

The most attractive element of the 44GS is the angular case, with its broad polished flanks, and a brushed plane in between the lugs. This watch dial marked the first time the GS logo appeared at 6 on the dial.

SBGW047

The SBGW047 limited edition is faithful to the original, with a 37.9mm case, but because of the new manually wound Grand Seiko 9S64 movement, the 1966 model thickness was 10mm and the SBGW047 is 11.5mm.

The Grand Seiko seal on the case back was gold filled in the 1966 model and is stainless steel embossed in the SBGW47 model

The 1966 model had acrylic glass and SBGW047 has sapphire crystal.

SBGW047 case back

Additionally, this reissue is also available in white, yellow and rose gold, each limited to 70 pieces. The model references are SBGW043, SBGW044 and SBGW046 respectively.

SBGW043 in white gold

The white gold SBGW043 model differs from the stainless steel SBGW047 because of its blue accented second hand and GS logo.

The line up is shown below.

44GS Historical Collection from 2013

While there have been many versions of the Grand Seiko since our article on the initial series of watches prior to production ceasing due to the Quartz Crisis, we will cover in this section reinterpretations of the original watches.

The introduction of the 9S55 calibre in 1998 has allowed the development of a whole range of Grand Seiko watches, but we cannot cover them all.

The J14070 with the Cal 3180 movement has been reinterpreted several times.

The earliest versions of the J14070 had Grand Seiko printed in black or carved into the dial, but in 1961 this changed to an applied signature. These models had Chronometer printed under the signature. Most of the models were gold filled, but platinum, and now more rarely found stainless steel versions were made.

In 2001 to celebrate the 120th anniversary of Seiko, a 300 piece limited edition of the Grand Seiko, SGBW004 was released in the JDM. (Grand Seiko models were sold exclusively to the JDM until 2010).

This was a yellow gold model. The dial has an applied signature and does not have Chronometer printed. Earlier models of the J14070 had the SD symbol, overlapping 4 pointed stars, which indicated a Special Dial with gold hour markers, and this model continues this tradition.

SGBW004 from 2001 limited edition of 300

The movement was the 9s54 from 1998, with 50+ hour reserve.

Then to celebrate the 130th Anniversary, Seiko reinterpreted the J14070 in all the original materials, gold (SBGW040), platinum (SBGW039) and stainless steel (SBGW033).

120th anniversary limited edition case back

The gold version was a limited edition of 130 watches.

The 9S64 movement was developed for this release and is a 24 jewel movement that uses Spron 510 (an in house developed alloy proprietary to Seiko) mainspring which gives the movement a 72 hour power reserve.

The SBGW040 has what Seiko calls a box-shaped sapphire crystal, while the original had a domed plexiglass as was common for the 1960s. The 2011 model differs in that the SD symbol is missing, and also has a narrower lug bevel, but a bigger crown.

The platinum version SBGW039 also comes in a 130 piece limited edition.

SBGW040 from 2011 limited edition of 130

This has a silvered second hand.

Stainless steel SBGW033

The SBGW033 was in stainless steel, and 1300 pieces were produced.

The Grand Seiko Rebrand

In 2017 Seiko rebranded Grand Seiko as a brand in its own right.

To celebrate this occasion, Grand Seiko have again released reinterpretations of the first Grand Seiko from 1960, the J14070 with the Cal 3180 movement.

SBGW252 in gold had 353 pieces in limited edition. The SD symbol has reappered on the dial, indicating gold indices.

sbgw252

The watch is bigger than the original J14070 and the above 2 reeditions, moving from 36mm to 38mm.

Grand Seiko’s own in-house caliber 9S64 manually wound movement is used, delivering 72 hours of timekeeping when fully wound.

There are 1,960 examples in steel, 353 in gold, with subtle design

SBGW251 platinum SBGW252 yellow gold SBGW253 stainless steel

The details that set the platinum SBGW251 apart go beyond the case metal. The dial is made of 18k gold and finished with a radial brushing, while the hour markers are similarly 18k gold.

The Grand Seiko signature is engraved onto the gold dial. The engraved signature is found only on the platinum model, as is the specially regulated movement. The calibre 9S64 inside the platinum version is rated to -1 to +5 seconds day, compared to -3 to +5 seconds for the other two models.

This is the most limited of the limited series, at 136 pieces – in honour of Seiko’s 136th anniversary.

The SBGW033 is similar to its precious metal peers, but the hour markers are steel, explaining the absent SD logo. A blued steel seconds hand is used.

The Grand Seiko lion emblem on the back of the steel watch is a solid gold medallion.

differences between them. But each is a winner. At $5,700, the steel SBGW253 is also one of the year’s best bargains.

The original Grand Seiko watch and the line of watches that followed would be a game-changer for the Japanese watchmaker. The Grand Seiko range would prove that Seiko was capable of producing quality watches that could compete with and even exceed those produced by Swiss watch manufacturers.

Before the introduction of Grand Seiko, high-end watch consumers did not think highly of the company despite Seiko producing quality watches and bagging awards.[1] The Seiko Crown and Chronos movements both were at the peak of Japanese technology, but the Grand Seiko turned it from an inferior watch manufacturer to a major player in the luxury watch market.

The “grand” moniker would be significant for this change. It mirrored the company’s goal of creating “the best luxury watch in the world.” In 1960, the company’s Suwa division was tasked to create the best watch it could possibly make at that time.[1]

The timing of the Grand Seiko’s introduction to the market also proved crucial to its success. The Grand Seiko Chronometer Cal. 5722 was introduced in 1964, the year Tokyo hosted the 18th Olympiad.[2]

Seiko served as the event’s official timer. The company brought simple countdown chronographs with Cal 5718A movements and mono-pusher chronographs with Cal 5717 and Cal 5719 movements.[3]

Because of its successful participation at the Olympics, Seiko finally gained international respect and credibility.

Seiko is the official timer of the 1964 Olympics

The 1964 Olympic Games was only the beginning of Seiko’s quest to leave a permanent mark on the high-end watch market. The company entered the Grand Seiko into the Neuchatel chronometer testing from the year the watch was released until the trials ended.[1] The Neuchatel observatory rated and ranked the movements that it tested, making it possible to see which ones were most accurate.

When Seiko first joined the international competition, it placed 144th. Three years later, in 1967, Seiko moved into the top 10. When the testing stopped in 1968, Seiko was running for first place. Rumor has it the testing ended so Neuchatel could avoid declaring Seiko as the winner in the Swiss chronometer competition. [1]

Undeterred, Seiko joined the equivalent Geneva competition in its quest to win first place. This time around, it wasn’t disappointed. Its Grand Seiko watches ranked 4th to 10th places, making the line’s movements among the most accurate in the world.[1]

Production of the Grand Seiko line ran for 12 years. The first Grand Seiko was produced on December 18th 1960 while the last one was made in 1972.[4]

The Suwa Seikosha division produced most of the Grand Seiko watches, except for the 44GS, 45GS, and 45GS VFA movements, which were created by its Daini Seikosha division. The two companies were Seiko’s subsidiaries which produced one brand to improve technology and hedge risk amid tough competition. If one experienced problems in production, the other would simply increase production. Suwa Seikosha became Seiko Epson Corporation, while Daini Seikosha became Seiko Instruments Inc.[5]

Seiko started manufacturing its first-generation Grand Seiko 3180 model in December 1960 at the company’s Suwa factory in Nagano prefecture in central Japan.[4] A total of 36,000 units of the first generation watch were created.

The 57GS movement followed in 1963 with 81,000 units manufactured.[5]

Afterwards, Seiko produced the 44GS and 62GS movements. Released in December 1967, Seiko created 36,000 units of the 61GS line.[6] This was followed by the 45GS, 45GS VFA, 19GS, and 19GS VFA movements from 1968 toward 1970. Finally, Seiko released the last model in this line, a mechanical 56GS, in 1972. [4]

Seiko’s design concept for the Grand Seiko was to create the “ideal watch,” which meant “nothing less than the best luxury watch in the world.”[7, 8] For the company, this meant the Grand Seiko should have its own unique style that would resonate with the high-end market. Specifically, Seiko wanted the Grand Seiko’s style to suit both casual and formal attires.[9]

When the original Grand Seiko watch was created in 1960 by the company’s Suwa Seikosha division, its focus was on quality mechanics. [10] It wasn’t until 1967 when the 44GS movement was released that the “Grand Seiko Style” by designer Taro Tanaka would from then on define the style of the series as well as all future Seiko products.[10]

The Grand Seiko range is also highly valued for its craftsmanship, particularly the traditional way in which the watches are created.[11] Every Grand Seiko watch was polished by hand using the“Zaratsu” technique. This is a traditional way of polishing that Japanese watchmakers use to create watches that have a mirror finish with no distortion. [9, 12]

The 1967 44GS movement, or “The Grammar of Design”, was so iconic that in 2013, Seiko released a limited edition watch based on it, the Grand Seiko 44GS. The replica or remake was powered by a manual 9S64 movement that closely mimics the original.[3] The limited-edition model had two variants, one was the same as the original (700 units stainless steel) and the other came in white, yellow, and rose gold (70 units each).[13]

The Grand Seiko Historical Collection 62GS was another classic revival. The collection included four limited editions: stainless steel with 600 units produced and three gold variants – yellow gold, rose gold, and white gold – with 100 units each.[14]

The original Grand Seiko 3180 was produced in replica, model number SBGW033, and 1300 units were produced.

Although “Grand Seiko” is the name given to the entire range, it could also refer to the original Cal. 3180 model when speaking of particular variations within the range.

L to R: Seiko’s first GS, the 3180; Cal. 3180 movement; an early GS with carved characters on the dial; GS 3180 back case with the lion logo

The 3180 model was based on the “Crown” movement, which featured 25 functional jewels at 18,000 bph and was hand wound.[18] It was the first chronometer grade watch manufactured in Japan and was based on an internal Seiko standard and certification. As such, it had the “Chronometer” label on the dial and a lion logo on the case back. The model number was J14070.

The initial accuracy rate of the 3180 model and the first Grand Seiko standard (-3 to +12 sec/day) was that of the Basel Observatory Chronometer standard at the time, and when this was changed to -1 to +10 sec/day in 1961, the second Grand Seiko standard changed to a slightly different 11 second range (-3 to +8 sec/day). [53,54]

Most of the cases were made from 18k gold-plated (80 microns), although platinum cases were also produced.[5, 52] Rarely, stainless steel cases existed, with the lion symbol on the case back, but with chronometer under, rather than Grand Seiko above.[51,56] It had a snap-type back lid and was non-waterproof. The crown of this model was coarse knurled.

This below is a relatively rare first model 3180 with a carved dial.

The first Grand Seiko with a carved dial

The initial characters on the dial were either printed black or the carved characters as in the image above. This was later changed in 1961 to applied characters in relief as engraving was error-prone and inconsistent. This is the most commonly found dial.[50]

The case back featured an embossed lion with the words Grand Seiko, and the i nside case back was engraved 14K Gold Filled J14070 GS.

Above is a Stainless Steel model [56]

The 57GS “Self-Dater” variations (from left to right): 5722-9990 with AD Logo, 5722-9990 without AD logo, 5722-9991 also known as the “Calendar Model”, and 5722-9011 in gold

The 57GS “Self-Dater” introduced in 1963 was the only other model that featured “Chronometer” on the dial. After its introduction, Seiko stopped using the label and started implementing the Grand Seiko Standard.[23]

A timeline diagram will show the overlap between models, with an overlap in production between all models.

The 57GS “Self-Dater” was so called because it had a quick set date mechanism. It was the first watch to use a date complication.[3]

The 57GS had four variations: 5722-9990, 5722-9010, 5722-9011, and 5722-9991. The most common variations are the 5722-9990 and the 5722-9991 models which succeed one another. The 5722-9010 and 5722-9011 are successive gold cap models.

The range’s first model, however, was the Grand Seiko Taiyo 43999 with the 430 movement. The watch features a matte pearl silver sunburst dial, steel baton markers, and steel dauphine hands. The model also has a distinct aperture for the date – a silver steel window frame – at the 3 o’clock mark.[45]

The crown is coarse knurled, although this changed to fine knurled later in the production run. The image above (and first image on the header) shows a three-pointed star inside a triangle, which is the Applique Dial (AD) symbol. It indicates that Seiko used an applique for the logo rather than printing it on the dial, a technique which wasn’t exclusive to Grand Seiko watches.[45]

Earlier models had the SD symbol, overlapping 4 pointed stars, which indicated a Special dial with gold hour markers.

Seiko 57GS’s 430 movement and case back with the lion medallion.

The 430 movement was a step up from the 3180 movement in the first Grand Seiko model.

All models of the 43999 have the Chronometer inscription on the dial and have the lion medallion on the case, a Seiko symbol of chronometer grade.

As can be seen above, the Cal. 430 movement 43999 was cased in a heavily lugged stainless steel case with threaded case back and is waterproof to 50 meters.

As the Cal. 430-43999 model was phased out it overlapped with the Cal. 5722 model. The 5722A was the first generation of 5722 which was produced in 1965. The movement operated at 19800 bph. The watch featured the Chronometer label on the dial, while the 5722B had a fine-knurled crown. Both featured the “W SEIKO” imprint on their crowns.[45]

Later in the production run, when the word “Chronometer” was removed from the dial, the case back also changed. The lion medallion was removed, and the case just featured GS. This did not necessarily mean the Grand Seiko model but that the Grand Seiko Standard of movement had been utilised. There is overlap between the dials with and without Chronometer, and case backs with and without the lion medallion or GS medallion.

Later versions of 5722 did not retain the Chronometer dial legend due to the lack of independent Commission Internationale des Controles Chronometriaues (CICC) certification facilities in Japan. The model initially used the second Grand Seiko standard of -3 to +8 sec/day introduced in 1961 [53].

By 1966, the GS Standard was implemented on all Grand Seiko watches, setting a higher level of precision and reliability than any yet achieved by Seiko and even higher than the International Chronometer standards.

Today, the Grand Seiko standard remains higher than today’s chronometer standards involving more tests in more positions and more temperatures.

The model is more commonly called the 5722-9990 model (pictured above – 2nd image) and can have a coarse knurled crown or fine knurled crown. It mostly has a lion medallion case back.

This 5722-9990 model does not have the AD logo, and the movement was engraved 5722A. Both the 430 and 5722A movements were called “tadpole” movements.

A rare Toshiba 25th anniversary with 5722B movement, the lion medallion and a fine knurled crown. Model 5722-9970. Case back in Kanji with 1965. Later versions have GS on the dial, the GS medallion on the back, and 1968.

The 5722B model (third image on heading) generally dispenses with the word “Chronometer” and is known as the Calendar model. The model number is 5722-9991. The caseback is the GS medallion. It had GS Standard official approval and operated at 19,800 bph. It also featured coarse knurled and fine knurled crowns.

This has rack and pinion regulation, not tadpole regulation.

The 5722-9010 model was a gold cap version of the 5722-9991. This model is rare and the case back reads GC.

The 5722-9010 gold cap model with the lion medallion back

The 5722-9010 pictured above was a more heavily gold plated model. The variant below is another gold cap version with white dial and gold markings. This has the GS back and reads CAP GOLD.

Daini Seikosha released the 44GS in 1964 as a King Seiko Chronometer initially, but because of its appeal and growing reputation as an accurate chronometer in 1966, it became the 44GS Grand Seiko.

Taro Tanaka, Seiko’s first hired graduate of a College Design Program came up with design rules which eventually came to be known as the “Grammar of Design” at Seiko. He wanted Seiko watches to sparkle brilliantly when on display and without any distortions.

Perfectly flat surfaces and angles for cases, dials, hands, indexes

Two Dimensional faceted curves for the bezel

All distortion should be eliminated from the dial, hands, indexes and case, the finishing of the dial and case should be a mirror finish so it shines and sparkles

No more round cases, a unique case design

Only Grand and King Seiko watches benefited from this design as the new case design required very expensive and labour intensive polishing and finishing. This is what makes the 44GS so special along with it being the first Grand Seiko made by the Daini factory and the first time the GS logo appeared at 6 on the dial.

The first models had DIASHOCK on the dial, and did not have the Daini logo.

Later models just had the Daini logo.

The difference in Movement between 44GS Grand Seiko (4420B) and the King Seiko Chronometer (4420A) is the control device for the second hand. The case design was changed to emphasize the beauty of a straight line. This formed the basis of later models, 45GS and 61GS.

Production was limited and models are rare.

The back lid is a screwback type and it guaranteed 50 m depth waterproof.

Short lug or pillowcase style and only stainless steel models of this type were produced. No date facility.

The 62GS and its four variations (from left to right): 6245 – 9000 and 6245 – 9001 both with day complications; 6246 – 9000 and 6246 – 9001 with day/date complications

By early 1966, the Grand Seiko line would have two manual-wound chronometers, the Self-Date 5722 and the no-date 44GS as seen above. With the Japanese’s exclusion from eligibility for a COSC (Contrôle Officiel Suisse des Chronomètres) certification, Seiko would, later on, have to rebrand this model that would become the 62GS.

This Grand Seiko model was originally called the Seikomatic Chronometer and housed an automatic movement, the calibre 6200, introduced in 1966. Seiko was forced to drop the word “chronometer” as a result of the Swiss COSC’s appeal to the watch manufacturer’s self-certification of chronometer ratings. These Seikomatic Chronometer models were the 6245 – 9000 model which is pictured above on the left with a day complication and the 6246 – 9000 model which is day/date.

These had Chronometer and Seikomatic Diashock 35 Jewels on the dial and Chronometer 35 Jewels engraved on the movement rotor.

Both of the Seikomatic chronometers had a back case reading Seiko within a lion medallion, and these models are commonly referred to as Lion Medallion models to distinguish them from the 62GS.

The rebranded Seikomatic Chronometers were then launched in July 1966 as the 62GS and came in two models: the 6245-9001 and the 6246-9001.

The 6245-9001 had a 35 jewel automatic movement and featured a date complication while the 6246-9001 had 39 jewels with both date and day complications. Both models oscillated at 19,800 bph. In terms of design, these new models were considered to be on the high-end side with its bezel-free case construction, a mirrored, multi-faceted case, and Grand Seiko’s highly-regarded “Zaratsu” polishing. It is distinguished by a flush-mounted crown at 4 and a contoured case. The crown position was at 4 and “hidden” to emphasise that the watch was automatic and did not need a winding crown.

This is the 6245 – 9001 model with a faceted case

This line had four variations: 6245-9000, 6245-9001, 6246-9000, and 6246-9001. The models 6245-9000 and 6246-9000 are not Grand Seiko models, but are closely related, and are known as Lion Medallion models.

The 6245 – 9001 dispenses with Chronometer and Seikomatic and has GS and Grand Seiko badging.

The engraving Chronometer has been removed from the rotor.

The 6245 -9001 has the GS caseback but some lion case backs may exist as part of the transition from the 9000 model.

The 6246 – 9000 model (see the third image on the header) is again branded Chronometer and for this model, Seikomatic was written in script. Also, the word “Chronometer” is inscribed in its rotor. The model has the lion medallion caseback.

This has Chronometer on the rotor.

The 6246 – 9001(pictured above, fourth image) has GS and Grand Seiko badging, but some models carry the lion medallion on the back, despite the dial clearly being Grand Seiko.

Another line of automatic watches, the 61GS family, featured higher alterations and were called “Automatic Hi-Beat.” These watches came out in the late 1960s and had the Seiko 6100 movement at 21,000 bph. The 61GS has 20 variations: 6145-8000, 6145-8020, 6145-8050, 6146-8000, 6146-8010, 6146-8020, 6146-8030, 6146-8040, 6146-8050, 6185-8010, 6185-8020, 6185-8021, 6185-7000, 6155-8000, 6156-8000, 6156-8001, 6156-8010, 6156-8020, 6156-8040, and 6186-8000.

V.F.A (Very Fine Adjusted) models boasted accuracy of one minute per month for the first two years of ownership

There were 36,000 watches produced for these two models, in line with the 36,000 bph engineering in the movement.

The seven basic 61GS models were as follows:

Ordinary 61GS models have a 4 in the third digit, and are 614x movements, regulated to the Grand Seiko standard of -3/+5 sec/day.

The Special 61GS models, have a 5 in the third digit, utilising either the 6155A or 6156A movements, and were introduced in late 1970 for a 10,000 Yen premium. These movements were regulated to the Grand Seiko Special standard of -/+3 sec/day. Special features on the dial.

6185A (1969-1972) – V.F.A., date only 6185B (circa 1972-1975) – V.F.A., date only 6186B (1972-1975) – V.F.A., day/date

The VFA (Very Fine Adjusted) movements have an 8 in the third digit and achieve -/+2 sec/day accuracy.

The movement is one of Seikos finest, a 25 jewel automatic hi-beat that operates at 36,000bph, made at their Suwa factory. It can also be wound manually and has a hacking feature. It is finished to a high level, with a nicely decorated rotor. The 61GS movement achieved the Seiko internal GS standard approval, which was adjusted to be within -3/+5 sec/day when it left the factory. The Special standard watches, on the other hand, achieved -/+ 3 sec/day. It is based on the 61 SeikoMatic 5 movement and was engineered with technology developed from data from the Astronomical Observatory Concours competitions that Seiko did extremely well in during the late 1960s.

The early 6145-8000 model had Grand Seiko written on the silver dial which was marked 8000TAD at 6 o’clock. The movement was marked 6154A and both GS (sometimes) and Grand Seiko on the rotor. There was a gold cap version of this model also. The chapter ring is dotted and is outside the indexes.

Later models had automatic under Seiko and also dispensed with Grand Seiko and had Hi Beat 36000 instead, and 8010TAD at the bottom of the dial. The rotor was marked Seiko.

The 6145 – 8000 was a date only model. The stainless steel model had 8010TAD on the dial and 8000 on the case.

6145 – 8000 versions, from left to right: Gold cap version which had 8010TAD on the dial and either STAINLESS STEEL or CAP GOLD and a medallion on the case; Gold plated version which had 8015TKT on the dial and 18K on the case back which was flat and had no medallion; and cross-patterned version with different raised index markers and 8030TAD on the dial. On this model the chapter ring is between the indexes with alternate long and short tick marks.

Another cross-patterned version of the 6145-8000

A grey dial version with 8040T on the dial and with baton hands and raised index markers and chapter ring inside the indexes, similar to the 6145-8020 model below was also produced.

The 6145 – 8020 was a pillowcase style with curious rectangular or baton hands. The case was similar to the Astron, but with a more rectangular style. (On December 25, 1969, Seiko marketed the world’s first quartz watch, the Seiko Quartz Astron).

Black and grey dial versions also were produced.

The case back has a medallion and is marked STAINLESS STEEL 6145-8020.

An Astron type case model with hammered or bark 18K yellow gold and linen dial marked 8050TKT was also available in limited quantities. The case back is marked 18K 6145-8030, without a medallion. The dial is either silver or gold. Silver case models are rare.

The 6145 -8050 model had a hardened stainless steel folded case and had only the words Hi-beat on the dial, not the 36000 (bph). The case back is engraved STAINLESS STEEL 6145-8050 and features the GS medallion.

This was the only calibre 61 Grand Seiko to feature a green dial. The hardlex crystal could be faceted. Black and grey dial versions also were produced.

The 6146 – 8000 was the day-date version of the 6145 – 8000.

The early 6146-8000 model is similar to the corresponding 6145 – 8000 model and had Grand Seiko written on the silver dial which was marked 8000TAD at 6 o’clock.

Later models have Automatic, Hi-Beat and 36000 on the silver dial which reads 6146-8020TAD

Gold cap version above with GOLD CAP on the case back.

Below is the cross dial version, with different raised indexes, and the dial reads 8030TAD

The 6146-8010 has a sapphire faceted crystal, and “flower carvings” around the GS marking on the dial. The case came as gold, and stainless steel.

The 6146 – 8020 is shown below with rectangular case and was produced a variety of dials, including a tea-stained colour. Hands were baton-style on some models with raised indices, and line minute divisions on a chapter ring inside the indexes.

The 6146-8030 below is an Astron style golf ball dimpled or bark finish version with an 18K yellow gold case, and starlight dial. Silver cases with a gold finis bezel were also available.

The 6146 – 8040 has a polished stainless steel case and a rare starlight dial.

This model had a hard steel folded casing and faceted crystal and various dial colours. These models have different raised indexes, a chapter ring inside the indexes, more baton-like hands and do not carry the 36,000 on the dial, but do have hi-beat engraved. The case is shared with the VFA model.

6146-8050 and its dial colour variations (White, black, and blue)

VFA movement. These models were put together by master watchmakers using selected parts and were accurate to +/- 2 sec/day.

Considered the best 61GS, the V.F.A. model had a Mean Monthly rate of +/- 60 seconds over the first two years. This translates to an accuracy of +/-2 sec/day compared to an ordinary 61GS at -3/+6 sec/day.

Characteristic of this model is: no VFA on the dial, a palladium case (hammered finish), no GS on the case back and thin pencil hands.

6185-8020 (pictured above): The first model has VFA on the dial, thin indexes and long thin hands. The second model has high raised indexes, and shorter hands as the hands are level with the indexes. Maybe this represents the transition to the 6185B movement from the 6185A movement, but both movements are used in this model, and VFA appears on the earlier model dials. Also shown in the image above is the watch’s VFA movement which is red gold plated.

A 6185-8020 model without the VFA wording on the dial

The hard stainless steel model, with raised indexes and 6185B movement.

A 18K VFA gold model, with champagne or cream linen cloth finish to the dial. Thin indexes and long hands. Marking on the dial is 7000TKT, and the caseback has no medallion.

Rated accurate to +/- 3 sec/day, and has “Special” written in gold on the dial. The 6155 is a day model, with the 6155A movement.

It has thin elongated bar indices and thin hands like VFA model above, which makes this a very elegant watch.

The 6156-8000 is the day/date version of the 6155-8000

The 6156-8010 SPECIAL is made of HSS (Hard Stainless Steel) and has a 3 sided faceted sapphire crystal as shown in the images below:

This was a GOLD CAP version marked SPECIAL in gold.

No lugged case, with a brushed finish. Medallion case back.

This model had the 6186B movement and is very rare selling for $10,000 to $20,000.

The feature of the watch, apart from the movement, is the deeply recessed dial, with tall indices.

The watch also features highly distinctive dial, markers, hands and case. The tall dark slate grey applied markers stand tall. To make room for these high markers, the hour, minute and seconds hands are kept short – rather than float over the markers, they pass short of them. The dial is a fine sunburst silver.

Another line with the “Hi-Beat” branding followed the 61GS line featured the hand-wound Seiko 4500 movement. The late 1960’s manual timepieces had improved to 36,000 bph and thus were called “Manual Hi-Beat”. Eleven variations are included in this line: 4520-7000, 4520-7010, 4520-8000, 4520-8010, 4520-8020, 4522-7000, 4522-7010, 4522-8000, 4522-8010, 4580-7000, and 4580-7010. The 4520-8020 is the only watch in the series to be Astronomical Observatory Chronometer Officially Certified.

The 45GS is one of the Grand Seiko models that housed the movement developed by Daini Seikosha at the astronomical observatory Concours. The other GS models that benefited from the technology were the King Seiko Chronometer and the King Seiko.

In 1968, Daini Sheikosha submitted 103 entries of its cal. 4520 to the Neuchâtel Observatory for chronometer certification. Swiss observatory chronometry trials were considered important and prestigious events in the watch industry at that time. These high beat movements ran at 36,000 bph as with the other prize-winning chronometers. Of these 103 watches, 73 passed as observatory chronometer-certified and the 4520-8020 is one of these 73.

In 1969 and 1970, a further 180 cal. 4580 movements were submitted and 153 passed as observatory chronometer certified.

All 226 certified models were made available to the public.[55]

The first model in the series is the 4520 – 7000.

The 4520A series did not have a date, and this model had a “folded” case.

It came in both Gold Cap and stainless steel with navy, and white linen look dials.

Other variants include navy – dialled versions and a gold-capped version with linen dial.

This is again the no date 4520A movement in a more oval shaped, rounded case, with a brushed finish. The dial was either plain or had 36000 on the dial.

Short lugged steel case following the grammar of design, which also came in Gold Cap.

Unique linen case 18 k pure gold model with a white dial.

This model is shown on the right below.

The next model in the 45GS date series is the 4522 – 7000

The 4522A calibre models had a date complication.

This came in stainless steel and gold cap with a variety of dials, white satin, black, and a cream linen look.

The case was a turtle shape with a “fold” at the lugs.

This has a more rounded brushed steel case and is a rarer model.

It was called the “Linear Beauty”, and has very thin hands.

It was the first GS with sapphire glass, and like the 4520-7010 model was either with, or without, 36000 0n the dial.

A more traditional short lugged case, as for the 4520-8000 version.

4522-8000 in stainless steel and gold cap versions. A comemmorative Toshiba employee model was made and is rarely found.

This model has a linen surface in 18K yellow gold, with a white dial.

The case is the same as that used in the legendary 4520-8020 Astronomical Observatory Chronometer (“AOC”), below.

This is a Chronometer certified model with a silver linen woven dial. Very rare as only 123 were produced. Many of those which passed the Neuchatel standard and then was sold to the public had daily deviation of +/- 0.175 sec/day[55].

The model is shown below on the right, with a 6185 VFA model on the left.

This model is an extremely rare VFA watch and very difficult to produce, and kept an accuracy of +/- 2 sec/day and +/- 60 sec/month for 2 years. Between 1969 and 1970 Seiko sold only 153 Cal 4580 watches as 4580-7000 or 4580-7010.[55}

The 4580-7000 with black dial and the Daini symbol

Another line of GS watches, the 19GS, is dubbed as the “Grand Seiko for Women”. Produced in the late 1960s to the early 1970s, the 19GS has three variations: Cal. 1984 VFA grade L4A, Cal. 1964 grade L3A, and Cal. 1944 grade L2A. The last 4 in the model number indicates no date.

The Cal 19 Hi-Beat was the first ladies size mechanical watch worldwide to run at 36,000 bph. It is shown below beside the Lord Marvel, the first Seiko watch to run at 36,000 bph.

The 1944 – 0012 model does not carry Grand Seiko and is sometimes dubbed a Queen Seiko.

This model was produced in 1969 and carries the CHRONOMETER designation, the first Japanese ladies model to do so.

This model has dauphine hands similar to the 62GS, and carries GS on the dial and caseback. Other models with pencil hands were produced.

Below is a ladies GS model found on the Grand Seiko website but without a model number, somewhat similar to the 6245 GS :

Finally, the last line, 56GS, was often referred to as “Ultra Thin”. It includes 18 variations: 5641-5000, 5641-7005, 5641-7000, 5645-5000, 5645-7005, 5645-8000, 5645-5010, 5645-7000, 5645-7010, 5646-5010, 5646-7010, 5646-7000, 5646-7005, 5646-7011, 5646-7020, 5646-7030, 5646-7040, and 5646-8000.

Most of the 56GS production process was automated beginning in the 1970s. The precision level suffered as a result of this transition, with a decrease in movement speed from 36,000 bph to 28,800 bph. The reliability level, on the other hand, increased and some people even consider the 28,800 bph to be the best speed for a watch movement, with its balance of maintenance, reliability and precision. As these were mass produced, it is easy to get maintenance parts for the 56GS even now, 40 years after its production, making it the most reliable of all the Grand Seiko models produced in the past. A slightly less finely tuned calibre 56 movement was also used in King Seiko and Lordmatics.

This was the date model of the model above, same style, and both gold and champagne dials.

A turtle shaped brushed case was used for this model.

All these 7000 and 7005 models had the Seiko GS medallion in gold on the back.

with 5645-7000 and 5646-7000 being the day and day/date versions.

Model 5641-7005 is the gold version with a linen dial, no date.

A Stainless steel watch with Arabic numerals. The bezel not polished and has a sand finish, while the dial has a variegated finish and reads 5646-7050T.

In all, the Grand Seiko series has 58 main variations. These feature different cases, case shapes, case-back and medallion, movement, dial, dial badge, crown imprint, and crown placement.

Seiko started with a manual movement for the Grand Seiko before releasing the series first automatic watch. The series used both mechanical and quartz movements.[15] The Grand Seiko had a total of 22 movements.

The first Grand Seiko featured a hand-winding movement CAL. 3180 at 18,000 bph, 25 functional jewels, and a hairspring that was developed in-house.[16]

The hand-winding movement continued with the Self Dater line which has 35 jewels. The line featured two movements, CAL. 5722 A and 5722 B. The former is 18,000 bph based on Seiko’s internal chronometer declaration, while the latter is 19,800 bph with GS standard official approval.

In The Grammar of Design, Daini added a hand-winding movement, CAL. 4420 B, set at 18,000 bph. [3] The movement was also used for Daini’s first King Seiko.

The 62GS or Self Winding was the first Grand Seiko manual chronograph. It had two movements (CAL. 6245 A and 6246 A), 26 jewels, and was set at 18,000 bph.

The 6200 movement was replaced by the much-faster Automatic Hi-Beat (36,000 bph), featuring a self-winding Seiko 6100 movement (CAL. 6145 A, 6146 A, 6185 A, 6185 B, 6155 A, 6156 A, and 6186 B) which had a power reserve of 46 hours or almost two days. However, creating the movement entailed too much labor so the company mechanized it the following year. The movement was used again in the 1975 Seiko 6159A movement and 6159B for a 600m diver. [3]

The Seiko 4500 movement (CAL. 4522 A, 4580/VFA, 4520 A) that powered the 45GS line was created to replace Daini’s 4440. [3] It is also the same movement in King Seiko 45KS. [3]

The 19GS family had a hand-winding movement (CAL. 1984 VFA grade L4A, CAL. 1964 grade L3A, and CAL. 1944 grade L2A), but the 56GS line (CAL. 5641, 5645 A, and 5646 A) that followed featured a self-winding Seiko 5600 movement.

Finally, the last GS line 56GS (CAL. 5641 A, 5645 A, and 5646 A) had a self-winding Seiko 5600 movement that first appeared in the 1968 Lord Marvel. Backed with 47 hours of power reserve, it was the movement of other watches until 1976, including the King Seiko 56KS, Seiko Duotime, Seiko Chronometer, and Lord Matic timepieces. [3]

Some watches of the Grand Seiko series have complications, but the original GS launched with none. So did The Grammar of Design, the Grand Seiko for Women, Manual Hi-Beat CAL 4580/VFA and CAL. 4520, and the Ultra Thin CAL. 5641 A.

The first complication was introduced in the Self Dater line, with CAL. 5722A or “Taiyo”. The Self Daters, and the rest that followed featured a date indicator, except CAL. 6246 A, 6146 A, 6156 A, 6156 B, and 5646 A which had Day/Date indicators.

The many variations in the Grand Seiko series can be characterized by their dial colors, dial badge, stick markers[41], and case-back medallion, among other things. The series, however, lacks lume[42] and subdials[4].

The original Grand Seiko CAL. 3180 came in two dial colors, plain white and silver sunburst. The latter is prominent from in the 57GS, 44GS, and 62GS lines.

Watch collectors should note that model 6145-8050 has a green dial color which is rare. Models 6146-8020 and 4522-7000 with a black dial, 6146-8040 with a starlight dial, and 6146-8050 with a blue dial are also rare specimens of this series.

Grand Seiko watches consistently had dauphine hand style, but later on, Seiko added obelisque and index/fils. The latter two were introduced in the Automatic Hi-Beat GS watches and lasted until Seiko ended production of the vintage GS line.

Model 6146-8030 is also said to have gold-plated hands.

The dial badge features a specific set of words and special logos, some of which are distinct to a specific line, movement, or model. Here are the highlights.

The “Grand Seiko” moniker can only be seen in the Grand Seiko CAL. 3180, in 62GS CAL. 6245 A, 61GS CAL. 6185 A and CAL. 6185 B, and in models 6186-8000, 4580-7000, and 5722-9990.

Meanwhile, the “Chronometer” marking is only sported by four models: Grand Seiko CAL. 3180, 5722-9990, and 6245-9000 and 6246-9000 in transition.

“Diashock” is featured in the dial badge of the first GS through the 62GS line.

The 61GS and the 56GS lines have the Suwa logo, while the 45GS line has the Daini logo. Also in the 61GS movement, Seiko started to use “Hi beat” on the dial, which signified that the watches had higher frequency of beats than the average watches available during that time.[14]

Manual Hi-Beat model 4520-8020 is the only watch in the entire series to have the inscription “Astronomical Observatory Chronometer Officially Certified” in its dial badge. The Daini logo and “Seiko” also appear in the watch’s face.

The entire 56GS line is characterized by a dial badge that has the Suwa logo and the words “Seiko,” “Automatic,” “GS,” and “Hi beat.”

The Grand Seiko series cases measured 31-38mm x 40-44mm, excluding crown. They are screwback and have “water-resistance to 50m depth” or “water-proof” (44GS and 19GS) inscribed on them.

Seiko started out making the cases round, but introduced cushion in model 6145-8020. It also used tonneau in models 5641-5000 and 5645-5000, while models 5645-5010 and 5646-5010 had square cases.

Seiko initially started using a stainless steel case for its watches and only added gold details later on. From the first Grand Seiko to the 62GS line, Seiko used a pure stainless steel case. It also used stainless steel for its 19GS and 19GS VFA.

Toward the end of the series’ production, Seiko started to feature gold cap or gold plating. A total of eight variations of the 61GS, 45GS, and 56GS families included either of these features, including 18-karat gold for models 6185-7000, 4520-8010, 4520-8020, 5641-5000, 5641-7005, 5645-5000, 5645-7005, and 5646-700. Three models, 6146-8000, 6156-8020, and 4520-7000, feature a gold cap. Meanwhile, 6145-8000 is available in gold and stainless steel.

The original Grand Seiko CAL. 3180 and the three models that followed (5722-9990, 5722-9010, and 5722-9011), as well as 6246-9000, all featured a lion emblem. Seiko used the emblem to denote “chronometer-grade.”[43]

All the rest featured “GS”, except CAL. 6185 A, CAL. 6185 B, CAL. 4580/VFA, and in models 4520-8010, 5641-5000, 5641-7005, 5645-5000, 5645-7005, 5645-5010, and 5646-7005.

Although most models were unsigned, a number of watches in the Grand Seiko range had crown imprints.

The original Grand Seiko CAL. 3180 had “S”, while the 57GS movement had “w seiko”. The 44GS, 61GS, and most of 45GS and 56GS movements had Original signed “GS”. Model 4520-7000 featured “G”, while models 4520-8020 and 5646-8000 were unsigned. Meanwhile, model 5645-5000 featured “GS” and the Japanese flag.

Also notable is the crown placement in model 6245-9000, which is set at 4 o’clock.

Only three models have crystals and bezels in the entire Grand Seiko range. Both belong to the 61GS line. Two models, 6146-8030 and 6185-7000, sport gold-plated bezels. The former also features a plexi glass crystal instead of acrylic, which Seiko mainly used for its watch glass. Another model, 6146-8010, comes with a sapphire crystal.[44]

Watch collectors have to understand that the Grand Seiko range is a luxury line with only limited quantities produced. It is considered to be Seiko’s signature watch. As such, prices of these watches today typically run near or in the thousands of dollar range, depending on condition.[45,46]

The Grand Seiko range is noted for its accurate movement. The least accurate among the GS watches has a higher rating than “almost every other brand’s best”,[11] which is great for collectors. Watch enthusiasts who want to start their own Grand Seiko collection can basically pick any of the many variations available. They would still end up with a very accurate watch.

However, for those unsure which model to pick, the original Grand Seiko (Cal. 3180) and the Hi-Beat watches (Cal. 6145A, 6146A, 6155A, 6156A, 5641A, 5645A, and 5646A) are great places to start.

Those looking for something more unique should go for those models with the rare dial colors, case-back medallion, shape, or crown imprint.

As a refresher, GS model 6145-8050, 6146-8020, 4522-7000, 6146-8040, and 6146-8050 all feature rare dial colors. Meanwhile, models 5722-9990, 5722-9010, 5722-9011, and 6246-9000 are the only Grand Seiko watches with the lion emblem. Model 5645-5000 is the only one to feature the Japanese flag in its crown imprint, while models 5641-5000 and 5645-5000 have tonneau cases and models 5645-5010 and 5646-5010 have square cases.

Those looking for the most valuable GS watch should look no further than “The Grammar of Design” (44GS Cal. 4420B). This is the model that’s most remembered when talking about the Grand Seiko line. The watch’s design is even called the “Grand Seiko Style”, and Tanaka’s design is so iconic that all Seiko products that were released afterward emulated it. This is a certified must-have for any watch collector.

In design, construction, finish and quality, the 61GS easily compares and stands tall with any of its contemporaries. While the Omega Constellation, Rolex Oyster Perpetual and Longines Flagship might garner more attention, the Grand Seikos are just as good in all aspects if not better. Vintage Grand Seikos represent an amazing value for a hi-end dress watch. Because they were not marketed to the US in the 1960s, they can be more difficult to find these days than their Swiss counterparts. That said, they can be had with patience and perseverance. A nice example of a 61GS can be found anywhere from $800 to $1500 depending on condition and seller/market. I know that many people dismiss the notion of a hi-end Seiko, but once you hold one of these in your hands, you can instantly recognize the inherent quality. They are a classy, well designed, engineered and executed watch, true high art horology.

In 2011, to mark its 130 anniversary as a company, Seiko created a limited edition reissue of the first Grand Seiko model.

In 2013 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of its first wristwatch, Seiko remanufactured the 44GS model, the 44GS Historical Collection. The true reproduction, Grand Seiko SBGW047 is a limited edition of 700 pieces in stainless steel.

Daini Seikosha released the 44GS in 1964 as a King Seiko Chronometer initially, but because of its appeal and growing reputation as an accurate chronometer, in 1966 it became the 44GS Grand Seiko.

Taro Tanaka, designed the watch and his design rules eventually came to be known as the “Grammar of Design” at Seiko.

Only Grand and King Seiko watches benefited from this design as the new case design required very expensive and labour intensive polishing and finishing.

The most attractive element of the 44GS is the angular case, with its broad polished flanks, and a brushed plane in between the lugs. This watch dial marked the first time the GS logo appeared at 6 on the dial.

The SBGW047 limited edition is faithful to the original, with a 37.9mm case, but because of the new manually wound Grand Seiko 9S64 movement, the 1966 model thickness was 10mm and the SBGW047 is 11.5mm.

The Grand Seiko seal on the case back was gold filled in the 1966 model and is stainless steel embossed in the SBGW47 model

The 1966 model had acrylic glass and SBGW047 has sapphire crystal.

Additionally, this reissue is also available in white, yellow and rose gold, each limited to 70 pieces. The model references are SBGW043, SBGW044 and SBGW046 respectively.

The white gold SBGW043 model differs from the stainless steel SBGW047 because of its blue accented second hand and GS logo.

The line up is shown below.

While there have been many versions of the Grand Seiko since our article on the initial series of watches prior to production ceasing due to the Quartz Crisis, we will cover in this section reinterpretations of the original watches.

The introduction of the 9S55 calibre in 1998 has allowed the development of a whole range of Grand Seiko watches, but we cannot cover them all.

The J14070 with the Cal 3180 movement has been reinterpreted several times.

The earliest versions of the J14070 had Grand Seiko printed in black or carved into the dial, but in 1961 this changed to an applied signature. These models had Chronometer printed under the signature. Most of the models were gold filled, but platinum, and now more rarely found stainless steel versions were made.

In 2001 to celebrate the 120th anniversary of Seiko, a 300 piece limited edition of the Grand Seiko, SGBW004 was released in the JDM. (Grand Seiko models were sold exclusively to the JDM until 2010).

This was a yellow gold model. The dial has an applied signature and does not have Chronometer printed. Earlier models of the J14070 had the SD symbol, overlapping 4 pointed stars, which indicated a Special Dial with gold hour markers, and this model continues this tradition.

SGBW004 from 2001 limited edition of 300

The movement was the 9s54 from 1998, with 50+ hour reserve.

Then to celebrate the 130th Anniversary, Seiko reinterpreted the J14070 in all the original materials, gold (SBGW040), platinum (SBGW039) and stainless steel (SBGW033).

The gold version was a limited edition of 130 watches.

The 9S64 movement was developed for this release and is a 24 jewel movement that uses Spron 510 (an in house developed alloy proprietary to Seiko) mainspring which gives the movement a 72 hour power reserve.

The SBGW040 has what Seiko calls a box-shaped sapphire crystal, while the original had a domed plexiglass as was common for the 1960s. The 2011 model differs in that the SD symbol is missing, and also has a narrower lug bevel, but a bigger crown.

The platinum version SBGW039 also comes in a 130 piece limited edition.

SBGW040 from 2011 limited edition of 130

This has a silvered second hand.

The SBGW033 was in stainless steel, and 1300 pieces were produced.

In 2017 Seiko rebranded Grand Seiko as a brand in its own right.

To celebrate this occasion, Grand Seiko have again released reinterpretations of the first Grand Seiko from 1960, the J14070 with the Cal 3180 movement.

SBGW252 in gold had 353 pieces in limited edition. The SD symbol has reappered on the dial, indicating gold indices.

The watch is bigger than the original J14070 and the above 2 reeditions, moving from 36mm to 38mm.

Grand Seiko’s own in-house caliber 9S64 manually wound movement is used, delivering 72 hours of timekeeping when fully wound.

There are 1,960 examples in steel, 353 in gold, with subtle design

The details that set the platinum SBGW251 apart go beyond the case metal. The dial is made of 18k gold and finished with a radial brushing, while the hour markers are similarly 18k gold.

The Grand Seiko signature is engraved onto the gold dial. The engraved signature is found only on the platinum model, as is the specially regulated movement. The calibre 9S64 inside the platinum version is rated to -1 to +5 seconds day, compared to -3 to +5 seconds for the other two models.

This is the most limited of the limited series, at 136 pieces – in honour of Seiko’s 136th anniversary.

The SBGW033 is similar to its precious metal peers, but the hour markers are steel, explaining the absent SD logo. A blued steel seconds hand is used.

The Grand Seiko lion emblem on the back of the steel watch is a solid gold medallion.

differences between them. But each is a winner. At $5,700, the steel SBGW253 is also one of the year’s best bargains.",38.88,9719

Liverpool to Build Gay Quarter

Oct 10 2005

Written by Ross von Metzke

Liverpool City Council voted unanimously on Monday (19th September) to back the idea of creating a gay quarter in the already liberal city.

The ambitious plan was first put before the council earlier this month. Now that the plan has received full council support, the city planning department has announced it will begin to map out the neighborhood’s boundaries and work on a plan to attract gay businesses to the area.

This marks the first time an LGBT village has been specifically created by an act of a city council. In most cities, gay neighborhoods have historically sprung up on their own, usually as the result of several gay focused businesses opening or a boom in the real estate market.

In Liverpool, the village will be planned out with a strip for businesses and an area for housing surrounding it. The group of people who proposed the plan said they did so out of a sense that Liverpool needed a strong unified LGBT community to economically help develop its decaying central core.

Although Liverpool has its fair share of gay bars and clubs, they are currently spread throughout the area. With no village as a focal point, Liverpool has yet to host its own gay pride celebration.

Council members said they would look to neighboring city Manchester as a guide. Manchester has one of the most vibrant gay communities in Europe and annually attracts thousands of LGBT visitors from around the world.

“We hope to get moving on it very quickly and we want to talk to businesses who are already gay-friendly and also the gay community to get their ideas and suggestions about the way forward,” councilor Peter Millea said, according to 365gay.com. “Liverpool has always had gay-friendly bars, but they have never worked together as part of a strategy.”

José Reinaldo (Partido Comunista do Brasil): ""Coup opens a new phase of the political struggle in Brazil""

Source: Solidnet.org

The legislative-judicial-mediatic coup d’etat in Brazil is going on. On April 17, under authoritarian and farcical driving, the House of Representatives approved the admissibility of impeachment proceedings against the President of the Republic. In the coming days, the Senate welcome the decision, by simple majority, authorize the opening of the procedure and immediately result in expulsion for up to 180 days of President Dilma Rousseff from the post to which she was democratically elected, with 54 million votes.

By José Reinaldo Carvalho (*).

In few months, the Senate will took the predicable final decision, converted to the Court, under the Presidency of the Supreme Court. The traced and executed script in both congressional houses showed so far that there is a game of marked cards and the exercise of a relentless power of the majority made up of reactionary parties. There are not worth logic, rationality or the truth of the facts. It is an abominable counterfeit trial, led by disgusting politicians. A ritual used to give a false constitutionality to something that is already decided. . A judgment made as an expression of a coup, which does not take into account consistent legal criteria.

In recent days, another throw into unbelievable coup plot, aimed at medium-term future: the request of the Attorney General to the Supreme Court to investigate President Dilma Rousseff and former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva for ""obstruction operation Lava Jato [1] "". Invested of Torquemada powers, the attorney general has denounced Lula as ""head of a criminal organization"" in the operation of the so-called ""petrolão [2] "".

The coup in motion is not circumstantial, the result of some random fact or operation of weaknesses and possible government tactical errors and progressive parties. To think so would be the same of believe that the first electoral defeat of Lula, in the distant 1989, to the TV edition of the infamous debate with the candidate who would become victorious, Fernando Collor. Moreover, consider that the inauguration of neoliberal-conservative cycle from Fernando Henrique Cardoso's election in 1994 would have been the result of judicious and a skill advertising operation of the ""victorious launch"" of the Real Plan. It would also be naive to suppose that the impeachment process is a personal reaction of the President of the House of Representatives to the vote of PT deputies in the Ethics Committee in favour of his impeachment.

Casual events have their weight, but we can understand them just in a general context and objective, the development and outcome of political and social contradictions.

Brazilian ruling classes are hostile to democracy, social progress, the sharing of property or income, justice, social advancement of workers and popular masses. They do not accept reforms or political and social changes that put in check their privileges.

We can say the same about the geopolitical position of the Brazilian bourgeoisie. It alternates the neo-colonial subordination to the imperialist powers with a great power complex associated with these same international potentates, both attitudes contrary to a progressive alignment on the international concert and performance of a role proactive for peace, democratization of international relations and the sovereign integration of Latin America. It is clear and consolidated phenomenon that the Brazilian ruling class is also unpatriotic, strategic reserve of world hegemony plans of the imperialist powers. Their own interests are not national and are malleable to the imperial strategies.

It was ever thus, since its constitution as a class in the 18 and 19 th centuries, the time of colonial slavery, a trace transmitted by inheritance to the capitalist landowners and the current monopolist and financial bourgeoisie. In addition, it will so, until there is a political and social revolution in the country, to build a new power under the leadership of the working class and its political representatives.

While they supposed that Lula's election in 2002 opened only a small gap in the political development of the country and they showed a cynical satisfaction in fining the commitments and moderation in vogue as a political phenomenon that they could live whit for a short term, these classes remained in their observation post or in a discrete readiness

Strictly speaking, it lasted two years, because the scandal of the ""“mensalão [3] ” (2005) and all its legal and political outspreads, were the milestone of the coup that are consumed now.

The coup in motion reveals a great convergence of neoliberal and conservative forces. Political parties of wide spectrum of parties, except that from the left, in collusion with sectors of the Public Ministry, the Supreme Court and the Federal Police, to consummate the coup, inflict a stinging defeat to the progressive and left forces that in the past 13 years ruled the country under the leadership of the Workers Party (PT).

Neoliberals and conservatives formed during the last 13 years a kind of oppositional condominium, which took its most complete form in the second round of the last presidential election and the current coup offensive, whose genesis came from elections and earlier clashes.

Nothing more explicit about the nature of the alliance coup and the political and ideological essence of the forces that are part of that full programmatic convergence. The ""bridge to the future"" Michel Temer and platform ""principles and values"", which was delivered to him on Tuesday (3) by Senator Aécio Neves, the PSDB [4] , are faces of the same coin.

In its essential aspects, there is also convergence with generic formulations of former Mayor of São Paulo, Gilberto Kassab, a reactionary stubborn, who never came off the conservative tenets of his original party, the old PFL [5] current DEM [6] .

Among the forces that always acted in the centre-left, there were also those who prepare imitations of democratic programs, with marked opposing to the left and the government of president Dilma. Foremost among these the PSB, now under the control of a group that now has nothing to do, except for honourable individual exceptions, with the Party of Jamil Haddad and Miguel Arraes.

When the neoliberal platforms of the PPS [7] and Solidarity Parties are put together to those ones, we can observe that programmatically all coup forces are combined as the antidemocratic, anti-popular and anti-labour nature. They national betrayal forces of an eventual post-coup government.

The contradictions, which are not few, refers themselves exclusively to lower physiological interests, aiming to take immediate advantage and electoral clash 2018.

There is a common denominator: the coup forces have an anti-reform political agenda by which they will promote the anti-democratic regression of the Brazilian state. We will have the end of social achievements; total openness to international financial capital; the return of privatizations; submission to the dictates of monopoly capital, that they are committed to promote the repeal of laws that now ensure the social and labor rights. There will also a civilizational setback, assuming the dictates of the canons of retrogressive Pentecostal churches, promoting attacks on achievements in the field of social coexistence, civil rights and human rights.

It makes all sense that the coup that promotes the overthrow of president Dilma Rousseff’s government gains the consensus of the whole monopoly-financial bourgeoisie, the big industry and big merchants, landowners, the media, the upper-middle class and everything that has the stench, the grotesque and idiotic essence of the Brazilian bourgeoisie. It is noteworthy that all employers' organizations, among which stood out the notorious Fiesp [8] , the shrill, cartoonish rightist Paulo Skaff [9] , have published formal and solemn declarations in favour of the coup

The coup in motion demonstrates the entire failure of the Brazilian political system, the ultimate break with the constitutional democratic order established by the Constitution 1987-1988.

Regardless of the outcome of ritual of impeachment in the Senate, the political struggle enters in a new stage and rises to highest level. Without prejudice to the electoral struggle and institutional action in parliaments and local and state governments, the political struggle of the masses, the grassroots organization, the strengthening of popular and unionist organizations went to the primordial place.

In addition - a priority issue - the building of unity of left and progressive forces enters at order of the day, the Popular Brazil Front is a germ, with a broad perspective to unite all susceptible forces in the defense of democracy, social progress and national sovereignty. With a program of resistance and struggle that show immediate tasks of medium and long term, the scope of which is the holding of democratic structural reforms and progressive.

The commitment of the left forces to fulfil this task is greater as deeper could be the understanding of why the support base of the government has collapsed. It will be need to uplift a new political pact, a progressive front, and accumulate forces to ensure the hegemony of the popular-democratic and anti-imperialist camp. From the angle of analysis and the interests of these forces, it is necessary to formulate a strategy and a tactic to avoid any kind of adaptation to the neoliberal and conservative order.

Mutations observed in the PMDB [10] behaviour and other central forces, and their desertion of a democratic and patriotic project, were not abrupt. They have occurred over a political process in which they were ceasing to be progressive parties. In the case of the PMDB, it is something that is set from the failure of the government Sarney and the presidential candidacy of Ulysses Guimarães, in 1989. The recent events finally demonstrate that this party, under the direction of Michel Temer, had no credentials to play a role as the main guarantor of the government coalition in parliament, much less to occupy the strategic post of vice-president of Republic.

With clear objectives, programmatic beliefs, strategic thinking and a sense of the historical moment, the left sees the current crisis and the new unfavourable conditions as a step of struggle. The clarity with which it shows the division between the antagonistic camps of political struggle, does not annul, on the contrary reinforces, the need to combine firmness and combativeness with spaciousness and flexibility tactics, without illusions or confusion related to the character and the strategic objectives of various political subjects.

The criminalization of the left, the ferocity with they seek to outlaw the PT and exclude other sectors of institutional life, making the former president Lula ineligible, and submit it, as President Dilma, to the legal penalties, including deprivation of liberty, indicate the level of attack on progressive forces. This also gives us an indication of the dimensions of the new challenges.

The fight against the coup aroused immense democratic consciousness and the ability to fight of millions of Brazilians who aspire to democracy, social justice and national sovereignty, human rights, good governance, cultured life and high civilizational standards. It had been the same in the decisive clashes of the second round of the presidential election in 2014.

There is an accumulated energy, which will develop on its own dynamics, in order to become into driving force behind the realization of urgent transformations, of revolutionary sense, which the Brazilian society is asking for.

José Reinaldo (Partido Comunista do Brasil): ""Coup opens a new phase of the political struggle in Brazil""

The legislative-judicial-mediatic coup d’etat in Brazil is going on. On April 17, under authoritarian and farcical driving, the House of Representatives approved the admissibility of impeachment proceedings against the President of the Republic. In the coming days, the Senate welcome the decision, by simple majority, authorize the opening of the procedure and immediately result in expulsion for up to 180 days of President Dilma Rousseff from the post to which she was democratically elected, with 54 million votes.

In few months, the Senate will took the predicable final decision, converted to the Court, under the Presidency of the Supreme Court. The traced and executed script in both congressional houses showed so far that there is a game of marked cards and the exercise of a relentless power of the majority made up of reactionary parties. There are not worth logic, rationality or the truth of the facts. It is an abominable counterfeit trial, led by disgusting politicians. A ritual used to give a false constitutionality to something that is already decided. . A judgment made as an expression of a coup, which does not take into account consistent legal criteria.

In recent days, another throw into unbelievable coup plot, aimed at medium-term future: the request of the Attorney General to the Supreme Court to investigate President Dilma Rousseff and former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva for ""obstruction operation Lava Jato [1] "". Invested of Torquemada powers, the attorney general has denounced Lula as ""head of a criminal organization"" in the operation of the so-called ""petrolão [2] "".

The coup in motion is not circumstantial, the result of some random fact or operation of weaknesses and possible government tactical errors and progressive parties. To think so would be the same of believe that the first electoral defeat of Lula, in the distant 1989, to the TV edition of the infamous debate with the candidate who would become victorious, Fernando Collor. Moreover, consider that the inauguration of neoliberal-conservative cycle from Fernando Henrique Cardoso's election in 1994 would have been the result of judicious and a skill advertising operation of the ""victorious launch"" of the Real Plan. It would also be naive to suppose that the impeachment process is a personal reaction of the President of the House of Representatives to the vote of PT deputies in the Ethics Committee in favour of his impeachment.

Casual events have their weight, but we can understand them just in a general context and objective, the development and outcome of political and social contradictions.

Brazilian ruling classes are hostile to democracy, social progress, the sharing of property or income, justice, social advancement of workers and popular masses. They do not accept reforms or political and social changes that put in check their privileges.

We can say the same about the geopolitical position of the Brazilian bourgeoisie. It alternates the neo-colonial subordination to the imperialist powers with a great power complex associated with these same international potentates, both attitudes contrary to a progressive alignment on the international concert and performance of a role proactive for peace, democratization of international relations and the sovereign integration of Latin America. It is clear and consolidated phenomenon that the Brazilian ruling class is also unpatriotic, strategic reserve of world hegemony plans of the imperialist powers. Their own interests are not national and are malleable to the imperial strategies.

It was ever thus, since its constitution as a class in the 18 and 19 th centuries, the time of colonial slavery, a trace transmitted by inheritance to the capitalist landowners and the current monopolist and financial bourgeoisie. In addition, it will so, until there is a political and social revolution in the country, to build a new power under the leadership of the working class and its political representatives.

While they supposed that Lula's election in 2002 opened only a small gap in the political development of the country and they showed a cynical satisfaction in fining the commitments and moderation in vogue as a political phenomenon that they could live whit for a short term, these classes remained in their observation post or in a discrete readiness

Strictly speaking, it lasted two years, because the scandal of the ""“mensalão [3] ” (2005) and all its legal and political outspreads, were the milestone of the coup that are consumed now.

The coup in motion reveals a great convergence of neoliberal and conservative forces. Political parties of wide spectrum of parties, except that from the left, in collusion with sectors of the Public Ministry, the Supreme Court and the Federal Police, to consummate the coup, inflict a stinging defeat to the progressive and left forces that in the past 13 years ruled the country under the leadership of the Workers Party (PT).

Neoliberals and conservatives formed during the last 13 years a kind of oppositional condominium, which took its most complete form in the second round of the last presidential election and the current coup offensive, whose genesis came from elections and earlier clashes.

Nothing more explicit about the nature of the alliance coup and the political and ideological essence of the forces that are part of that full programmatic convergence. The ""bridge to the future"" Michel Temer and platform ""principles and values"", which was delivered to him on Tuesday (3) by Senator Aécio Neves, the PSDB [4] , are faces of the same coin.

In its essential aspects, there is also convergence with generic formulations of former Mayor of São Paulo, Gilberto Kassab, a reactionary stubborn, who never came off the conservative tenets of his original party, the old PFL [5] current DEM [6] .

Among the forces that always acted in the centre-left, there were also those who prepare imitations of democratic programs, with marked opposing to the left and the government of president Dilma. Foremost among these the PSB, now under the control of a group that now has nothing to do, except for honourable individual exceptions, with the Party of Jamil Haddad and Miguel Arraes.

When the neoliberal platforms of the PPS [7] and Solidarity Parties are put together to those ones, we can observe that programmatically all coup forces are combined as the antidemocratic, anti-popular and anti-labour nature. They national betrayal forces of an eventual post-coup government.

The contradictions, which are not few, refers themselves exclusively to lower physiological interests, aiming to take immediate advantage and electoral clash 2018.

There is a common denominator: the coup forces have an anti-reform political agenda by which they will promote the anti-democratic regression of the Brazilian state. We will have the end of social achievements; total openness to international financial capital; the return of privatizations; submission to the dictates of monopoly capital, that they are committed to promote the repeal of laws that now ensure the social and labor rights. There will also a civilizational setback, assuming the dictates of the canons of retrogressive Pentecostal churches, promoting attacks on achievements in the field of social coexistence, civil rights and human rights.

It makes all sense that the coup that promotes the overthrow of president Dilma Rousseff’s government gains the consensus of the whole monopoly-financial bourgeoisie, the big industry and big merchants, landowners, the media, the upper-middle class and everything that has the stench, the grotesque and idiotic essence of the Brazilian bourgeoisie. It is noteworthy that all employers' organizations, among which stood out the notorious Fiesp [8] , the shrill, cartoonish rightist Paulo Skaff [9] , have published formal and solemn declarations in favour of the coup

The coup in motion demonstrates the entire failure of the Brazilian political system, the ultimate break with the constitutional democratic order established by the Constitution 1987-1988.

Regardless of the outcome of ritual of impeachment in the Senate, the political struggle enters in a new stage and rises to highest level. Without prejudice to the electoral struggle and institutional action in parliaments and local and state governments, the political struggle of the masses, the grassroots organization, the strengthening of popular and unionist organizations went to the primordial place.

In addition - a priority issue - the building of unity of left and progressive forces enters at order of the day, the Popular Brazil Front is a germ, with a broad perspective to unite all susceptible forces in the defense of democracy, social progress and national sovereignty. With a program of resistance and struggle that show immediate tasks of medium and long term, the scope of which is the holding of democratic structural reforms and progressive.

The commitment of the left forces to fulfil this task is greater as deeper could be the understanding of why the support base of the government has collapsed. It will be need to uplift a new political pact, a progressive front, and accumulate forces to ensure the hegemony of the popular-democratic and anti-imperialist camp. From the angle of analysis and the interests of these forces, it is necessary to formulate a strategy and a tactic to avoid any kind of adaptation to the neoliberal and conservative order.

Mutations observed in the PMDB [10] behaviour and other central forces, and their desertion of a democratic and patriotic project, were not abrupt. They have occurred over a political process in which they were ceasing to be progressive parties. In the case of the PMDB, it is something that is set from the failure of the government Sarney and the presidential candidacy of Ulysses Guimarães, in 1989. The recent events finally demonstrate that this party, under the direction of Michel Temer, had no credentials to play a role as the main guarantor of the government coalition in parliament, much less to occupy the strategic post of vice-president of Republic.

With clear objectives, programmatic beliefs, strategic thinking and a sense of the historical moment, the left sees the current crisis and the new unfavourable conditions as a step of struggle. The clarity with which it shows the division between the antagonistic camps of political struggle, does not annul, on the contrary reinforces, the need to combine firmness and combativeness with spaciousness and flexibility tactics, without illusions or confusion related to the character and the strategic objectives of various political subjects.

The criminalization of the left, the ferocity with they seek to outlaw the PT and exclude other sectors of institutional life, making the former president Lula ineligible, and submit it, as President Dilma, to the legal penalties, including deprivation of liberty, indicate the level of attack on progressive forces. This also gives us an indication of the dimensions of the new challenges.

The fight against the coup aroused immense democratic consciousness and the ability to fight of millions of Brazilians who aspire to democracy, social justice and national sovereignty, human rights, good governance, cultured life and high civilizational standards. It had been the same in the decisive clashes of the second round of the presidential election in 2014.

There is an accumulated energy, which will develop on its own dynamics, in order to become into driving force behind the realization of urgent transformations, of revolutionary sense, which the Brazilian society is asking for.

Raul Gallego Abellan

Hong Kong: The Umbrella on Fire Commissioned by The Intercept Watch the full film here

Entry details.

Five years after the failure of the peaceful pro-democracy protests known as the Umbrella Movement, a huge swath of Hong Kong’s citizens were determined to stop the central government in Beijing from further eroding the “one country, two systems” promise it made in 1997. This short film captures the first days of how the leaderless movement decided to take a step forward and confront police – and how the riot units decided to start the crackdown on protesters. Throwing rocks at police stations and using petrol bombs to confront riot police shooting rubber bullets and tear gas were things that the protesters had to learn to do, and fast.

Judges comments.

“The panel of judges were unanimous in their view that this entry was as much a piece of art as it was a piece of news. It was a visual ballet that rhythmically portrayed the frenetic push and pull between the security forces and protesters. Not classic news reporting, but a unique and powerful digital piece that left the viewer more able to connect with the issues that inspired it. The piece illustrated what all news outlets had been conveying for months, but in a new and powerful way. Raul self-funded this trip and aimed to capture the emotions of both sides – he delivered.”

Jackson Found Guilty of First-Degree Murder, Sexual Battery of Andrea Boyer

| Published on: Feb 18, 2023 | |

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: David Chapman Phone: (904) 255-3004 Cell: (904) 524-6626 [email protected]

Feb. 11, 2023

JACKSON FOUND GUILTY OF FIRST-DEGREE MURDER, SEXUAL BATTERY OF ANDREA BOYER

State Attorney Melissa Nelson announces that a Clay County jury has found Michael R. Jackson guilty of First-Degree Murder and Sexual Battery in the 2007 killing of Andrea Boyer. With the verdict, Jackson faces death for his crimes. The Honorable Don Lester will conduct the sentencing portion of this trial with the jury the week of Feb. 21, 2023.

On the morning of Jan. 23, 2007, the Clay County Sheriff’s Office responded to a veterinary clinic on Wells Road after an employee found a coworker, Andrea Boyer, murdered inside the business. An investigation determined Boyer had been disrobed, sexually battered, stabbed, strangled, and hit repeatedly in the head with a fire extinguisher. DNA evidence – later verified to be semen — was collected from Boyer’s body and submitted to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which ran the sample through CODIS, a DNA database. Results confirmed it was Jackson’s DNA.

The State in trial presented evidence of a sexual battery from 1986 that Jackson was convicted of and for which he served time in prison. This evidence showed a pattern of related criminal behavior, a lack of consent, and revealed similarities in motive and manner in which Jackson committed the crimes.

The case was investigated by the Clay County Sheriff’s Office and Florida Department of Law Enforcement, and prosecuted by Assistant State Attorneys Dan Skinner, Pam Hazel, and Ashley Terry.

Previous

Next

This was a simple, quick soup when I got home late.

Ingredients:

4 medium potatoes, peeled and cut into cubes

3 shallots finely chopped

3 leeks finely sliced

bunch of dill roughly chopped with stalks removed

4 tablespoons Greek yogurt

2 litres of chicken stock (or vegetable stock)

squeeze of lemon, to serve

knob of butter

How I made it:

Briefly sautée shallots in a knob of butter in large cast iron pan. Add potato chunks and stir, then add leeks. Pour in chicken stock. Cook for 30 minutes on a low/medium heat so just bubbling. Stir in most of the dill. Season well with salt (this is important). Turn off heat. Stir in the yogurt. Check for salt again (add more if needed). Serve into bowls and garnish with a teaspoon of yogurt, a bit of dill and a squeeze of lemon.

Eaten with:

Warm bread and butter.

60 Minutes Up, 60 Seconds Down: Adventures in Volcano Boarding

Posted on March 2, 2018 November 23, 2020 Author: Shelley Seale

One of the new weekly features at Trading Places is Flashback Friday, where I’ll share a favorite travel experience from my past — hopefully, to inspire your weekend travel dreaming! Today, for the first Flashback Friday, I’m going back to 2012 when I spent a few weeks in Nicaragua — and boarded down a live volcano just outside Leon.

Cerro Negro is a very young volcano. At a mere 161 years old, it’s a newborn baby in fact.

“The Black Hill” is one of 25 volcanoes in Nicaragua, of which 9 are active (or at least erupted in the last two thousand years). Cerro Negro is very definitely one of the active ones; in its young life it has erupted 23 times, or an average of every seven years. The last eruption was in 1999, so this baby is overdue for a hot lava and steam explosion.

We are about to climb this volcano – and then board down the other side.

Keith and I arrived in Nicaragua two days ago, flying into Managua and making our way first to Leon, a small colonial city to the north. I was told about the volcano boarding tours by INTUR, the government tourism office, and they set us up to go out with Va Pues, a local tour operator.

And so at 8 am on our second full day in Leon, Frankie arrives to pick us up and lead us on this adventure. Frankie is young and enthusiastic (I find out later he is 34, a bit older than he looks), and promises that the volcano will not erupt today. We stop at a hostel on the way out of Leon to pick up a couple of twenty-something guys who are going with us, Gary and Matt who are also both American.

“The motto for today is have fun, and don’t die,” Frankie tells us. Good motto.

It’s about a 45-minute drive out of town to Cerro Negro, bumpy after we turn off the main asphalt onto a rutted dirt road. We pass a lot of yoked oxen pulling carts filled with wood, water, and other necessities of life. “They are called junta ,” Frankie says of the oxen. “It means best friends; with your amigo, you are together all the time, side by side. That is how these oxen pairs get their name, always together.” Occasionally these carts are followed by men on horseback carrying machetes; presumably, to cut through foliage and hack down the small trees they harvest. At least, I hope that is what they are for.

We pass several wells and get out to take a closer look at one. Because this is on an elevated volcanic mountain, people must dig really deep to reach the water. This particular well is 160 meters deep, and it takes a junta pair to pull up the container of water from its depths. All of the community come to these wells to get their supply of water.

After a little more driving we reach the entry building for the volcano area – it’s a protected national reserve, and here you sign the guest book and pay your entrance fee of $5. We drive right past the sign that reads, “No Pasar – Zona de riesgo por eruptions volcanicicas inter” – or, “Do not enter – volcano eruption zone.”

We climb out of the vehicle with our boards – Keith has a stand-up style, like a snowboard, while Gary, Matt, and I all opted to ride down seated, toboggan style. I’ve read that you can go faster this way and the stand-up boards get bogged down in the volcanic gravel more easily; plus, I think I’ll feel more steady seated. Frankie leads us as we begin the ascent, along a very rocky trail up the side of Cerro Negro. After a few hundred meters the trail gets abruptly steeper, and the lava rocks beneath our feet are completely loose. It’s a little challenging finding a foothold, especially carrying the boards, but not hugely difficult.

Arriving at a peak, what turns out to be about the halfway point, we put down the boards to enjoy a spectacular vista. Several nearby volcanoes surround us, some active and others dormant and verdant with a rich green landscape. Just below us are several steam vents where Cerro Negro is releasing its gaseous fumes. We hike down, trampling over yellow sulfured rocks, and are persuaded to stand in the steam vents while Frankie takes our picture. I blame this for my subsequent light-headedness.

The next part of the climb proves to be the most difficult. We begin the trek along the exposed top ridge of the volcano, along a very narrow trail, and it’s windy. I mean, wicked windy. The boards we are carrying basically act as a sail, trapping the wind and threatening to pull my 110 pounds right over the edge of the ridge. I had thought of taking a picture along here but instead, I am concentrating hard on just staying upright, planting one foot cautiously in front of the other. For the first time, I begin to feel a little nervous. I’m sort of wishing I had let Frankie carry my board when he offered, but I don’t want to be a wimpy girl.

I’m really fighting the wind for purchase on the narrow ledge. I think about how my dad always teases me that I’ll blow away in the wind; if he could only see me now. He would definitely shake his head with the unspoken expression that says this was not one of my more brilliant moves. “Whose idea was this anyway?” I shout back at Keith. “Yours!” he reminds me. Oh, yeah. Damn me. That ride down better be worth it.

Finally, Frankie stops and leads us down to a path that’s a few feet below the very top; it’s still windy but a bit more sheltered and easier to navigate. A few minutes later we blessedly reach the spot from where we will board down the other side of this bad boy. I drop my board, relieved. After a look at the crater and some photo ops, Frankie does a quick demonstration of how to use the boards; the toboggan is pretty simple. Get on, hold on, and use your heels for brakes. Okay. We don helmets, safety glasses, knee, and elbow pads.

Keith, the sole stand-up boarder, goes first. He handles the board pretty well and starts down the black lava gravel. The board gets a little bogged down and it’s hard for him to go very fast, but it looks like a fun ride all the same. Then it’s my turn. I sit on the board, grab the rope handle, and lift my feet off the ground. The toboggans go much faster than the stand-up boards; immediately I pick up speed, and start careening from side to side. I plant my heels back down to slow; I haven’t gotten the hang of how to control the board and direction yet, and I’m a bit nervous of gaining speed and then wiping out. This isn’t snow, after all, or even sand. It’s small jagged pieces of lava, and I do not want to go sliding across them sans board.

The ride is pretty fun, though I admittedly keep my heels down most of the time. Every time I pick them up I start rocketing down and veering from side to side, so the potential speed of the toboggan is wasted on me. In a minute or two we are all at the bottom. It was a quick ride but a definite adrenaline rush ; I do wish the run was longer, or there were a couple of them because I just started getting the feel for how to control the board and it would have been fun to keep going and try a little more speed.

Keith says that while the snowboard-style was fun, he would have enjoyed the speed of the toboggan. Both of us, and Matt and Gary as well, all thought the entire experience was well worth it. The volcano boarding is of course unique and adventurous; but the scenery, climbing the volcano, and the entire hike (in spite of the moments of precariousness) were all just as good as the boarding itself.

Frankie was an awesome guide. After we remove our gear and load up in the battered four-wheel drive, we head back to the park entrance to wash our filthy arms and legs and have a cerveza fria, chatting about travel and our lives and getting to know one another a little more. Frankie tells us about the university he went to, and the many conferences and training on tour guiding that he has gone to. When I ask him what he likes to do in his spare time, when he’s not guiding tourists, he says climbing or boarding the volcanoes. He’s doing exactly what he wants to do anyway; this guy seriously loves volcanoes .

A lot of tour guides might be of the “It’s good money taking gringos to slide down a volcano, so that’s what I’ll do” variety. I’m not knocking that; it is a good way to make a living, and it’s an enterprising soul who goes after that opportunity. But Frankie has gone to school for this, continues his education on it, is passionate about both guiding and the topography and adventures available in his country, and takes it seriously. It’s a calling for him.

Later that night, we all meet up again at Via Via, a hostel and bar in Leon that is the spot for live music on Friday nights. Frankie meets us there along with Gary, Matt, and a friend, Casey, that they bring along from their hostel. A few beers with new friends, a good band, and a fun bar with a 50/50 mix of locals and visitors is a pretty stellar way to end an awesome day in Leon, Nicaragua.

Does biotin help hair growth?

If you’ve spent any time researching hair loss products online, the chances are you’ve come across biotin – it seems to be everywhere right now. It’s a popular supplement that lots of people are using to improve the health of their hair and to fight hair loss.

But does biotin really work? And are there any risks to taking it?

Here we delve into the science behind biotin and hair growth. We find out if it affects your hair and if it can be harmful to you.

What is biotin?

Biotin is a natural vitamin from the B family of vitamins. It’s usually counted as vitamin B7, but sometimes it’s also called vitamin B8. In Germany it’s called vitamin H because it’s so important for hair and skin (haar and haut in German).

Biotin is used by your body in a wide range of processes, but one of the most important is keratin production. Keratin is the main ingredient of hair (and also finger nails and toenails). It gives your hair strands structure, it makes them flexible and supple and it forms a protective layer around the outside of them. You need biotin to make keratin and you need keratin to make healthy hair.

Where can I find biotin?

Like other vitamins, you can find biotin in a variety of foods. Eggs are rich in biotin as are dairy products, especially Camembert and blue cheeses. Most nuts are biotin rich, especially almonds, as well as fatty fish like salmon and tuna too.

Meat including beef and chicken and a range of fruits and vegetables such as avocados, broccoli, bananas, spinach and other leafy greens are all packed with biotin.

And again, just like other vitamins, you can also buy a range of supplements that contain biotin . They’re a quick and easy way to make sure your hair is getting the biotin it needs.

Biotin is also added to various beauty products, like shampoos and conditioners, serums and creams.

What is a biotin deficiency?

A biotin deficiency is when your body doesn’t have enough biotin to function properly (your body is deficient in biotin).

A biotin deficiency can happen if you don’t get enough biotin in your diet (you regularly get less than the recommended 30 to 100 micrograms per day). Or if your body has a problem absorbing biotin, which can be caused by diseases, particularly intestinal conditions that stop your body absorbing nutrients effectively, like Crohn’s disease or by certain medications, including antibiotics.

If you have a biotin deficiency you can develop a red rash on your skin, your skin can dry and crack, you can feel fatigued, develop depression and have problems sleeping. Most importantly for hair, a biotin deficiency can make your hair brittle and prone to damage, it can even make your hair fall out.

What does the science say about biotin and hair growth

The research on biotin for hair growth is still very much in its early days.

A host of scientific studies have shown that taking biotin supplements can help re-grow lost hair. But all of these studies to date have been conducted on women who have health conditions that caused their hair to thin and fall out.

There’s no conclusive scientific research yet that shows biotin can help men regrow lost hair. This doesn’t necessarily mean biotin won’t help with hair loss though, just that it’s not yet proven. And there are anecdotal reports from men who claim biotin has worked for them.

As biotin doesn’t cause any known side effects it’s something you can try for yourself to see if it helps with your hair.

How much biotin should you take for hair growth?

Not getting enough biotin in your diet can harm your hair and can make it fall out. Experts recommend you get a minimum of 30 and 100 mcg (micrograms) per day, but lots of people advocate higher doses for hair health, as high as 2000 to 5000 mcg.

How long does it take for biotin to work?

The scientific research on biotin is still in its early days, but studies suggest that you can see results, like increased growth, thickness and shine, in as little as 90 days. If you have a biotin deficiency you may see results faster than this.

Are there any risks to taking biotin?

Biotin is a naturally occurring vitamin and something your body needs to function properly. It’s not a synthetic product.

And whilst some vitamins can become toxic at high doses, biotin isn’t thought to do so, as it’s not a vitamin that gets stored in your body if you take excess amounts (it’s water-soluble rather than fat-soluble). In the US there’s no recommended maximum daily amount of biotin that you can exceed.

No side effects have been found for taking biotin supplements either, even in high doses and it’s not thought to interact with any medications. The only known effect of taking large quantities of biotin is that it can interfere with the results of some blood tests.

Biotin supplements are safe, but if you do have any worries about taking them you should talk to your doctor anyway, just to be on the safe side.

Can taking biotin cause hair loss?

No, taking biotin won’t cause hair loss, even in high doses. Excess biotin isn’t stored in your body (you pee it out), meaning it doesn’t build up and become toxic. Your body takes the biotin it needs, then it gets rid of what’s left.

Is biotin for me?

If you have a biotin deficiency then biotin is most definitely for you. But even if you don’t have a biotin deficiency, increasing your biotin intake may help with your hair growth. The science on biotin supplementation is still in its infancy, although results so far are promising, but there are lots of anecdotal reports of people getting good results with biotin.

If you have male pattern baldness , the most common cause of hair loss in men, then biotin alone may not be enough. If you want to slow your hair loss, and even regain lost hair, two medical products that are scientifically proven to work are finasteride ( Propecia ) and minoxidil ( Rogaine ).

The good news is you can take finasteride, minoxidil and biotin together as a holistic treatment plan to maximize your hair growth. If you’re interested in finasteride, minoxidil and biotin you can order them directly FROM MARS.

The good news is you can take finasteride, minoxidil and biotin together as a holistic treatment plan to maximize your hair growth. If you’re interested in finasteride, minoxidil and biotin you can order them directly FROM MARS.",4.91,1227

Child Safety Awards

The Child Safety Awards are prizes for the youngest members of the CELSA Group ™ family. The objective of these awards is to reaffirm that in the Group nothing is more important than the safety of people . On the other hand, this initiative allows us to bring the Group closer to our family environment. The theme of the contest is the safety of parents at work, so that children should reflect on a drawing how their parents should protect themselves during their day to day. As our next step, we encourage the youngest participants to record a video with their parents explaining what they have drawn and what safety measures their parents must take during the workday so that they are completely safe.

Awards and recognitions of CELSA Group ™ For CELSA Group ™ recognitions are a fundamental aspect and an opportunity to value all those initiatives and attitudes that make the Group a better place. The awards allow us to recognize the people’s efforts and value those ideas that have had a direct impact on the Group and have helped us grow every day. The prizes awarded also allow us to highlight the most human factor of our team and highlight those behaviors that identify the most with our values.

AIR WAR OVER EUROPE 1939-1945 THE LUFTWAFFE TESTED TO THE LIMIT

Price: $94.00

Book Type: C,O,

by Dr. Manuel Wolf, very large heavy book, 831 page, more than 700 photos, aircraft profiles in colour, maps and accurately detailed scenarios.

Never before has such a comprehensive, detailed and at the same time exceptionally grippingly written book about aerial warfare over Europe been available. The author himself is now publishing a thoroughly revised, new edition of his book.

Dr. Manuel Wolf describes the aerial war which was fought over all of Europe’s major theatres of war and depicts the dramatic events from an entirely new perspective. With his flowing, lively, narrative style the author explains each sequence of events in a wholly innovative way, basing his chapters on themes and life histories as well as chronological events.

The wealth of extraordinarily detailed information helps the reader to comprehend the overall military context, both on the ground and in the air. All the important types of aircraft are compared in a unique, never before published summary of the technical data. Identification markings on the aircraft involved in the incidents are illustrated and the losses on individual battle days listed in a table. The book describes pioneering, technical developments comprehensively and depicts aerial combat in a precise and exciting way. Impressive, colourful images reveal to the reader the drama of the dogfights.

From the basic principles of aerial warfare to the investigative clarification of issues controversially discussed for many years, for anyone interested this book is an absolute treasure trove. With his love of detail Dr Wolf explains not only the decisive, major air battles. The ‘minor’ arenas, the emotional conflict of the pilots and the constant fear breathing down their necks are also vividly and palpably depicted.

The final section provides an unparalleled summary of technical data covering all the notable types of aircraft belonging to the warring powers in Europe. They are shown in altitude increments of 1,000 m and have never before been published in such a comprehensive way, making this book unique.

2008 – Jamie Little holds off Skinner

Tuesday May 20, 2008

One of the greatest reminders of why we participate in the Toyota Pro/Celebrity Race each year happens far away from the track, before the nail-biting and excitement begins.

On Thursday of race weekend, out of the glare of the media spotlight, we visit a local children’s hospital, and the smiles on those kids’ faces – as well as the drivers – are priceless.

In previous years, on the same day we visit the kids, all participants and instructors would ‘walk’ the track, corner by corner, to visualize and re-learn the circuit.

This year, and for the first time ever, there was on-track activity on Thursday, so it was more chaotic than usual and we were unable to do so. That night, however, we held our first drivers’ meeting to launch the race weekend and did our best without the benefit of the ‘walk.’

The next day, the first thing I noticed was that this race has become quite the mental challenge both on and off the track, and the ‘trash talk’ started almost from the get-go! I heard the drivers trying to get into each other’s heads, which turns the heat up on the competition. During the first (and only) practice session, an instructor rode in each car with John Salley, Nancy Lieberman and Raymond Cruz to give them as much help as possible because they hadn’t been able to attend Press/Practice Day due to various professional obligations.

During her practice run, Nancy kissed the tire wall coming out of Turn 8 just before the back straight, which meant the instructor really earned his keep since he was riding! I saw Mike Skinner towing some drivers out there during practice, leading them around and trying to set the pace, which is great for the other competitors as it allows them to run good, fast laps. I saw Daniel Goddard enter Turn 1 way too fast, but he had the presence of mind to use the run-off to turn around and re-enter the race track undamaged instead of hitting the wall – that was great!

Unfortunately, Brad Lewis smacked the tire wall pretty good going into Turn 9, but luckily he was not hurt. He simply lost focus for one split second and lost reference of his braking point.

Since Brad was the one who hit the tire wall, it was quite a surprise to see him pull it all together in the qualifying session to grab pole. (In all fairness, he was one of many who could have done it, because the field was soooo tight.) He overcame the incident in practice and showed great confidence and smoothness out on the racetrack. Qualifying always comes down to running ‘your best lap’ and many were running up front, but Brad was the one who nailed it. Jamie Little showed discipline behind the wheel and landed a starting spot in the front row (outside). Right behind them was William Fichtner, to round out a deserving top three.

Come race day, I can honestly say I hadn’t seen a race this good in a very long time. Brad Lewis took the lead off the start and led the pack through the first turn safely. Wilmer Valderrama got an excellent start as well, passing several cars before Turn 1. Jamie Little didn’t get the best start, but instead of getting frustrated, she rose to the challenge and strategically worked her way back to the front. After moving behind Lewis, she saw he had such a big lead that she wasn’t sure she could catch him. But as luck would have it – good luck for Jamie, not so good for Nancy Leiberman – a tow truck was sent onto the track to fetch the Basketball Hall of Famer’s car out of Turn 3 with only two laps to go – and out came the yellow caution flags, which bunched up the pack.

By this point, Mike Skinner had overcome the Pros’ :30-second handicap and had worked his way through the field of celebrity drivers. He was following Little and Lewis, and seeing that they were battling it out hard for the win, instead of passing them, he stayed back to let them race.

Meanwhile, with Little on his tail and one lap to go, Lewis once again lost sight of his braking point in Turn 9 – the exact spot he had his incident in practice – and slammed into the tire barrier. This opened it up for Little and Skinner to go by. Coming out of the hairpin, Skinner made a move, but Little gave it her all and was able to hold off the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Champion to emerge the overall victor in the Toyota Pro/Celebrity Race. The fans loved it, and for the second time in the 30-plus years of this race, a female participant won it!

Clausewitz in Orbit: Spacepower Theory and Strategic Education

BLEDDYN BOWEN

The politics of war and peace in space is an overlooked field. Space is a quiet and lonely place in war studies – despite space systems performing critical infrastructure roles in war, peace, politics, economics, and nuclear stability. In the mid-1990s John Sheldon and Colin Gray bemoaned the fact that there is no ‘Mahan for space.’ Neither writer apparently considered the possibility that they had answered their own plea, or in other words, that there is a Mahan for space: it’s Alfred Thayer Mahan . The 19 th century navalist is one of a constellation of strategic theorists (such as Clausewitz, Castex, Corbett, to name the most prominent) whose work I am applying to create a spacepower theory intended to inform the diverse strategic problems conflict in this new medium might pose.

What are the grounds for analogy from terrestrial warfare to space warfare? How can universal principles about war at the highest levels where politics and violence meet – i.e. strategic theory – be reasonably crafted and constructively used? I believe there are two crucial grounds for analogy from the Earth to space. The first is Clausewitz’s most famous dictum that war is a continuation of politics with the addition of other means. This idea, that war is political, allows Clausewitz to connect any wars that are infinitely variable in their details and see what is common between them in order to learn more about why certain decisions were made and the conditions within which those decisions were made. This is done by asking questions that are based on a grasping of a few universal principles. Regardless of the situation, a universal principle should help develop useful questions to ask of any given situation. The political nature of war pervades whatever we may understand as war. This provides a basic ground for examining wars and helps train the individual to appreciate why wars are so different. Why is one war more costly than another? Why was one war forfeited when the costs were so little when ‘total’ wars have destroyed entire states before resistance was crushed? The political aspect helps Clausewitz develop a strategic analogy for the better understanding and study of the phenomenon of war. This in turn should help practitioners better grasp their craft. Identifying thematic commonalities among wars helps identify their particular differences. Readers familiar with Clausewitz’s ‘remarkable trinity’ will no doubt appreciate the universality of passion, reason, and chance in every war, yet their manifestations are innumerable in their forms in history.

But what does this abstract theorising mean for space warfare? Space warfare – actions taken to destroy or interfere with enemy space systems – is not inherently escalatory, limited, ethical, a prelude to nuclear war, or inevitable. Space warfare will be a reflection of the political conditions of any belligerents that fight who happen to have a capability in using or denying space systems. Clausewitz, through stressing politics, brings the human element and the wider prevailing strategic context of any political violence to our attention. A recent series of articles on anti-satellite weapons and the risks of nuclear war fail to mention the realities of second-strike nuclear capabilities, the politics and psychology of nuclear threat perception, and the imponderable systemic political context that any single decision to attack will be within. Instead, select technological devices are ascribed a political value (stabilising or destabilising) without connecting the discussion to any political context between the established nuclear powers. These narrow arguments fail to adequately put space warfare in its strategic and political contexts and can impose blinkers on strategic thinking. Spacepower theory should help put these narrow arguments in their strategic contexts, and illuminate factors that have been omitted – in this case mutually assured destruction, second strike capabilities, and the politics and psychology of deterrence.

The second ground for analogy is that space warfare is best thought of as being comprised of as celestial lines of communication (a well-developed idea by John Klein ) and over the contest of a command of space. This of course is analogical to concepts of sea lines of communication and the command of the sea popularised by the seapower theorists Alfred Thayer Mahan and Julian Corbett. Along these lines or communication, information, wealth, and satellites travel either on Newtonian orbital paths or through data streams in the electromagnetic spectrum. Like sea lines of communication, denying the use of these celestial lines of communication may have an impact on a war. Indeed, the more an economy and military depends on those celestial lines of communication, the more lucrative a target those lines may become for an adversary. Though there are many problems by other authors on their use of seapower theory for spacepower theory, Mahan and Corbett, in conjunction with other lesser-known seapower thinkers make outer space more of a coastline than an open sea. Indeed, that is a central aspect of my spacepower theory. But, as Clausewitz and Mahan often argued, strategic creativity and good leadership escape quantitative analysis and defy mechanistic approaches to understanding war.

These two basic grounds of strategic analogy from warfare on Earth to outer space serve to illustrate how ‘Clausewitz in orbit’ works. But with such a qualitative approach, it is hard to declare success. Rather, only discussion and the academic process will deem spacepower theory of any use. Indeed, it is impossible for spacepower theory to be ‘correct’ – it can only be useful for the strategic education of the individual. This approach may be distasteful to some in an era of increasing quantitative analyses of educative practices and performance analysis.

By saying that war is political, I believe we can better see how thinking of space warfare must be mindful of Earthly politics and the human element. In this context, Clausewitz’s other concepts – of passion, reason, and chance, of friction, of the strategic defence being the stronger form of war – make more sense and become easier to apply critically to scenarios where our focus may be on what happens in Earth orbit and its interactions with terra firma. In a similar vein, when we use an analogy of celestial lines of communication and the command of space, it helps us to better think critically about other problems such as how decisive space power can ever be in war, what is the influence of spacepower upon (future) history, and how can belligerents respond to and learn from various forms of spacepower?

The critical application strategic analogies have led me to seven propositions of spacepower theory:

Space warfare is about the command of space

Space is a distinct geography but it is not isolated

Preponderance in space does not guarantee preponderance on Earth

The command of space is about exploiting celestial lines of communication

Earth orbit is a cosmic coastline

Spacepower finds itself in a geocentric mindset… and may outgrow it

Dispersion is a condition and effect of spacepower

These propositions show the headline outcomes of Clausewitz, et al., in orbit. As I near the end of my PhD research, I hope that my framework for spacepower theory helps take the next step in strategic thought about space, and to help understand more about astropolitics and questions of war and peace in orbit. Understanding the epistemology of strategic theory in a way that Clausewitz and Mahan did helps put limitations to my theory, but stresses their strengths and usefulness (see Jon Sumida’s Decoding Clausewitz and Inventing Grand Strategy and Teaching Command for discussions of this pedagogical approach to strategic theory).

It is necessary to finishing by stressing what strategic theory is not. Most strategic theory is not there to provide answers or axioms for success. In addition, knowing spacepower theory is not a prerequisite for good command judgment in space warfare. Neither is grasping spacepower theory a guarantee of making the best decisions. Strategic theory is meant to help an individual in one’s self-education on military-political matters by making problems more accessible to a reader in the absence ‘ genius .’ Spacepower theory should not only aim to make complex political matters over war and peace in space more comprehensible by grasping at the political roots of space warfare, but also to pave the way for an appreciation of creative and well-founded strategic thinking and command judgment in a realm so often dominated by technical or scientific mentalities.

This is what a Mahan for space is: distilling his Clausewitzian attitude to teaching command and strategy, and applying the seapower concepts of lines of communication to Earth orbit. With spacepower theory, outer space need not be such an undiscovered country.

Frau Clausewitz’s compilation of her dead husbands notes aside, the underpinning relationships in space are physics and well attested to by Dr Kessler. While ‘Gravity’ overstated the problem for cinematic values, the problems are real and space is not as much a ‘conflict domain’ as it is a ‘scarce natural resource’. Spacepower is a conceit that politics can trump physics and the ‘Darwin Awards’ celebrate similar conceits in other domains.

Interesting stuff, thanks for the post. I know that for several decades now, the USAF has struggled with developing a sound strategy for the employment of American space power. Have you looked at the theory of space power employment that places like SASS, AF Doctrine Center, and AFSPC (who has responsibility for organizing, training, and equipping space forces) have developed? I’m curious as to what big ideas they’ve come up with, and your take on them. That said, the whole “Mahan in space” approach has been tossed about for years, as well as silly ideas like “10 Propositions for Space Power” (a hijacking of the “10 Propositions for Airpower”) and a space organizational doctrine that is almost a carbon copy of air doctrine. The danger with the failure of (at least) the USAF to really think about this issue, as I see it, comes with a gross misreading of history. It thinks Mahan and Clausewitz contain the answers, but no one is really sure what the questions are. Americans, for example, have had a lots of trouble in defining the policy they want to take toward space warfare (for example, what is the US public policy on waging war in space — say kinetic ASAT attacks, or even e-attacks?) so unlike the RN and USN in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that had a farily clear naval policy on which to base a Mahanian strategy, the current space “warriors” have had a very hard time knowing what exactly they should be aiming for. But that problem is not a show stopper, even in time of a “space war.” Doctrine is just a political football, and it can be punted (American analogy here) with little cost when necessary. Warfighting, not so much. I contend that the real problem for the military space professional is the lack of an operational and tactical knoweldge base on how to “fight” in space. The USAF made some efforts in the late 90s and early 00s toward fixing this with the publication of some TTP documents (it tried to create a weapon system manual for space {AFTTP 3-1.28} just like there’s one for each airframe, and some other things under a program that can’t be named here, etc), but it quickly proved for naught when rice-bowl battles trumped the deep & revisionist thinking that the problem demanded. The USAF, for example, could not decide if space warfare was really glorified electronic aka information warfare, and vice versa; the concept of a Venn Diagram escaped it, so instead of moving forward and giving the warfighters something they could use, they produced nothing but some white papers that properly ended up in the shredder bin. Watching the “brain trust” try to create a Joint doctine for space power employment would have been comical if it hadn’t been so sad. After everyone spent their parochical bullets and then “agreed to disagree,” the Air Force decided it would just classify all its stuff so it did not have to talk with the other services about it, or anyone who wasn’t already indoctinated aka “read in” to the programs. So … what kind of obstacles have you encountered in trying to write an unclassified diss. on something that is classified out to Pluto and beyond? Trying to grapple with the problems of space warfare in a way becomes a Rumsfeldian (by the way, Rummy led the Blue Ribbon Panel on Space in the 21st Century just before he became Bush the Younger’s SECDEF, and had the bright idea that “Transformation” fueled by space power would allow the US to win in Iraq with far fewer troops that his field commanders said they needed) Catch-22: the Imperial You doesn’t know what You don’t know. How do you envision your doctrine, essentially your theory, informing how the US/UK/CAN/AUS wage the forthcoming space war against say the PRC or maybe the “space terrorists?” I really look forward to reading what you have to say. Cheers. PS please pardon typos; I used an iPad to type this.

Thanks very much for reading and for posting your comments! Thanks as well for your kind words. I have a few responses I hope you find interesting.

I have had the pleasure of meeting the people at SAASS, and I have looked at the published works of the authors there and some publically available essay work. They do good work, and I use it in the early stages of my spacepower theory. Your question becomes difficult to answer depending on what we mean by spacepower theory or doctrine. I believe they are two very different animals, but some people use those words interchangeably (as you seem to do at the end), and even then people have different opinions as to how they can be used and what kind of knowledge they represent. Hopefully the blog post explains well enough what kind of knowledge spacepower theory does. My spacepower theory is not a doctrine. It does not describe a military service’s mission roles, composition, duties, rules of engagement, advocate specific courses of action, institutional responsibilities, rules of best practice on deployment of specific equipment, etc.

Doctrine can be more than just a political football. Assuming you’re coming from a US perspective, I fully appreciate that statement! I’d recommend reading Hoiback’s work on doctrine, I found it very useful for my own study on doctrine and in teaching doctrine. I’m not as interested in space warfare doctrine because that’s an applied theoretical task for the needs of a specific military service at a specific time towards specific missions and contingencies, and often takes a more prescriptive or descriptive tone. My spacepower theory operates at a more universal level, presents what I think are universal problems in the conduct of space warfare and spacepower – not codes of best practice and categorisations of missions or roles (like some doctrine), but exploration of the possible given what we know about operating in space and exploiting it. This spacepower theory is for thinking about the politics of war in space (but the blog post above is more about the method and epistemology, rather than an exploration of my seven propositions).

Yes Mahan has been thrown around in space a lot. Corbett a few times, too! I don’t think they’ve been done well enough to my liking – others may disagree! What is difficult as well is when particular and contestable views of the theories from these thinkers are applied. In my thesis, my interpretation of Mahan differs considerably in some areas from others who have applied Mahan’s concepts to space. More importantly, I try to be as transparent as possible in the strategic analogies I make so that readers can follow them, and hopefully decide for themselves whether the interpretation and application of the theories are sound, or useful.

Your comments on Clausewitz and Mahan knowing the answers but we don’t know what the questions are – I think it’s the other way around. These classic thinkers do not have direct answers for us. They never did have answers to specific problems when they wrote about strategic theory (as opposed to actively advocating specific policies, like Mahan’s US fleet build-up or Clausewitz on Prussian resistance against France). Rather, thinkers like Clausewitz and Mahan have good questions or tools to help us ask good questions for us to find our own answers to specific problems. That is the purpose of strategic theory at its highest abstract level, I think. Paret said that theory is for study, and I believe a certain canon of strategic theories can help us study spacepower and space warfare, to come up with our own questions and answers based on the questions classic strategic theorists asked of the nature of war and politics. These seven propositions are tools to help study and consider the practice of spacepower.

You are absolutely right that we have little track record of space warfare – that’s why I resort to strategic analogies. We can still find useful thinking about war and peace in space from terrestrial experience. The way things are, we need to be thinking constructively about these things and increase the quality of strategic discussion on space, rather than wait for a war to happen and just hope that the right people will have given enough thought to how to do war in space. That’s relevant no matter which side of the Taiwan Strait you’re on, or whether or not you as a space user are on that Strait at all.

Electronic warfare is one means of many of going after celestial lines of communication, so space warfare is not just glorified EW, and EW is a different (but connected) thing to information warfare (assuming you mean cyber warfare?). Even so, EW against celestial lines of communication does demand space-specific knowledge on orbital physics and space technology.

I don’t know enough about the US’ inter-service politics when it comes to drafting spacepower (or doctrine?) documents – I’ll have to do some digging! Regardless, spacepower theory does not need the approval or acknowledgement of a military service (as an idea or a thing in its own right) to be valid in the field of strategic studies. Though it’d be nice, of course! People will still need to think about how spacepower fits into modern warfare at the highest strategic levels, therefore, I think spacepower theory will be useful to any who wish to do so, whether or not they’re in uniform and say in public that they do space warfare or not.

As for difficulties, once I knew I was doing spacepower theory, very few problems have come up in terms of classified information. Of course, I don’t know what I don’t know but those are generic epistemological problems. I can only use what I can find in the public domain, and since I’m not that concerned about the latest of the most sensitive space activities, and more concerned in creating a theory that educates about strategic thinking about spacepower, it wasn’t that much of a problem.

And yes, Rumsfeld and the Space Pearl Harbor. Never dull with him around. It’s impossible to escape the 2001 Space Commission when reading about American spacepower. Before transformation the buzzterm was RMA, and that’s addressed early on in my thesis as context-setting really. But my spacepower theory tries to get people to think about not just the exploitation of spacepower on Earth, but how it will be contested and denied. And we’d best have a good think about it even though we have little to no track record of a space denial or space control campaign between capable opponents.

As for your last question, I don’t know in detail. If it is to get any kind of attention in that regard, I’d only hope my theory provides practitioners with useful tidbits of strategic wisdom, like space warfare will reflect, and be a product of, the bigger politics at play on whatever the dispute is about on Earth. Space warfare is not isolated from Earthly politics. Additionally, I hope it can get people off the red herrings of space-based weapons and kinetic-kill weapons because they either don’t exist or are one of many options of taking out celestial lines of communication. Thanks to the works of Mahan, many strategists have a rough notion of how seapower, empire, and global trade works. I hope that spacepower theory can help people grasp the long-term universal fundamentals of how spacepower works in the context of politics and war in the modern political-economy that is stitched together by the space systems.

Thanks for your comments, excellent food for thought! I hope my responses are adequate.

Thanks so much for responding. Spacepower theory really isn’t my thing as a historian of the 18th century drawn to what Huw writes here, but it was cool ntl to read your stuff. It brought me back to my military days when I worked for an organization, back before the GWOT, focused on making sure US ground forces got all the support putatively available to them from the space assets “overhead.” One of the main issues I saw there was the chomping at the bit of the space community to be treated as more than a support arm of the combined arms/warfighting community. Frankly it was pathetic, but that’s a different story. The important thing, I think, for your work is that the “space cadets” could not in fact elucidate what they “brought to the fight.” They were obsessed with the weaponization of space, especially the PRC/PLA efforts to develop systems that would allow it to fight the “space war.” The cadets kept telling us that we would lose all our space-based ISR, navigation and positioning, and C2 capabilities. That would really suck to be sure, but it was real Chicken Little stuff. So there was talk about ASATs and killer satellites and defensive counter measures etc and relatively little effort to make sure the American sergant fireteam leader had the latest imagery of the bad guys’ entrenched positions over the hill. The cadets threw around a lot of Clausewitz and Mahan, but it was clear to me that very few of them ever read C & M other than the 2-paragraph synopsis that took off the internet: space is an American COG, we need to control the space choke points just like the RN cotrolled Gibralter and Singapore, we must have space supremacy [not just superiority], etc. Another biggie was “Space is a RMA,” but when I suggested that it might just be a MTR (because I knew they had never read Roberts or Parker and knew nothing of the work Soviet theorists had done on RMA/MTR) people looked at me like I was speaking a foreign language, which I think I was for a lot of the USAF theory and doctrine writers). That’s why I contend the US military space community has not asked the right questions and instead thinks it has the answers from the old dead white guys of the 19th century. The inch-deep/mile-wide theory was in place (hopefully you will change that), but the policy, strategy, and doctrine were absent. That’s why I think that separating theory from doctrine is a dangerous thing. Especially in the realm of space, where it is almost impossible to conduct exercises, all that remains are theories on which to base doctrine. Of course, there are wargames, but for space, those are essentially computer simulations, and as I watched several of them, it became clear to me that the wargames served as little more than a medium to build support for the acquisition of more space assets: SBIRS, space-based GMTI/AMTI platforms to “replace” AWACS/JSTARS, hyper-spectral imaging satellites to “find” hidden tanks that they enemy had protected with CCD, the list went on and on. I heard over and over again that space assets allowed the US military access to “denied territory” and would give us ‘information superiority” and “full-spectrum dominance,” but they never said who “we” were — see above about the sgt. fire-team leader. There were lots of theoretical buzzwords thrown about, but no one could answer the questions (the ones my PhD adviser pounded into my head) of “so what new here, and who cares?” In the end, I came to the conculsion that the US space community was a self-licking ice cream cone for a bunch of guys who had convinced themselves they were the “smartest guys in the room.” (I heard an USAF major general at the Space Operations Center at Vandenburg AFB actually announce that he indeed was the smartest guy in the room; as a lt col, I did not think it was my place to remind him that all the guys who came up with that saying ended up in prison, but I digress). Hopefully you can change that; I hope that somebody, somewhere, will use your theory to shape policies and strategy, and the US military in turn will use them to build a doctine of warfighting. I know, from what you said above, that that’s not really your intention, but I also think it’d be a shame if you did not peer into the gap (abyss?) between theory and doctrine. Of course, it’s your work, and I know how frustrating it can be when voices from the peanut gallery keep giving you “good ideas” as you try to finish your disseration. So, please take my insights for what they are worth (probably not much) and good luck with the diss. It’s back to the Seven Years’ War for me. Cheers :). PS please pardon typos as this is from an iPad.

Hi again. Thanks again for more comments (and for persisting through an iPad)! Very interesting to hear your perspective. I see what you mean now about the limitations of USAF’s approach to it and the (inter)service quirks. I hope that my finished thesis (and resulting book with any luck) can escape the gravity well of the USAF’s dominance (and to a lesser extent the critical mass inside the DC beltway) of spacepower theory/doctrine. I worry by getting into doctrine more I get too close to the egotistical battles of various bureaucracies, and the latest wishlists and pension schema of military services. The transition of space into a place where fighting or interference happens, or the ‘space segment’ being threatened should help more people outside of USAF see spacepower’s potential contribution to modern warfare and (grand) strategy. As for a supporting wing – that’s mostly it for spacepower. But reading Mahan’s ‘Influence’ book, I get the same impression about seapower. It boggles my mind how people can reduce Mahan’s ideas to only the big battle fleet and imposing a decisive battle.

I agree with you that Mahan and Clausewitz have only been engaged at a surface level (with some notable exceptions, though!). The space as a COG thing – it grinds my gears! Classic misuse of Carl’s concept in the way it’s usually presented.

At the end of the theory I hope there’s enough intellectual ammo for people to make the connections on how spacepower fits into wider political ends and economic gains (like Mahan does so well with his seapower history, I think).

Would it be possible for you to drop me a line at my email address – https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/interpol/staff/phd-students/bleddynbowen/ (my email addy is on there, rather not post it in the open here) – if you wouldn’t mind. I have some ideas on post-doc research and your experience and insight sounds like just what my research needs!

And the 7 years’ war is interesting! Though I know little of its history beyond Mahan and Kennedy, and playing through it in a certain computer game…

Clausewitz in Orbit: Spacepower Theory and Strategic Education

The politics of war and peace in space is an overlooked field. Space is a quiet and lonely place in war studies – despite space systems performing critical infrastructure roles in war, peace, politics, economics, and nuclear stability. In the mid-1990s John Sheldon and Colin Gray bemoaned the fact that there is no ‘Mahan for space.’ Neither writer apparently considered the possibility that they had answered their own plea, or in other words, that there is a Mahan for space: it’s Alfred Thayer Mahan . The 19 th century navalist is one of a constellation of strategic theorists (such as Clausewitz, Castex, Corbett, to name the most prominent) whose work I am applying to create a spacepower theory intended to inform the diverse strategic problems conflict in this new medium might pose.

What are the grounds for analogy from terrestrial warfare to space warfare? How can universal principles about war at the highest levels where politics and violence meet – i.e. strategic theory – be reasonably crafted and constructively used? I believe there are two crucial grounds for analogy from the Earth to space. The first is Clausewitz’s most famous dictum that war is a continuation of politics with the addition of other means. This idea, that war is political, allows Clausewitz to connect any wars that are infinitely variable in their details and see what is common between them in order to learn more about why certain decisions were made and the conditions within which those decisions were made. This is done by asking questions that are based on a grasping of a few universal principles. Regardless of the situation, a universal principle should help develop useful questions to ask of any given situation. The political nature of war pervades whatever we may understand as war. This provides a basic ground for examining wars and helps train the individual to appreciate why wars are so different. Why is one war more costly than another? Why was one war forfeited when the costs were so little when ‘total’ wars have destroyed entire states before resistance was crushed? The political aspect helps Clausewitz develop a strategic analogy for the better understanding and study of the phenomenon of war. This in turn should help practitioners better grasp their craft. Identifying thematic commonalities among wars helps identify their particular differences. Readers familiar with Clausewitz’s ‘remarkable trinity’ will no doubt appreciate the universality of passion, reason, and chance in every war, yet their manifestations are innumerable in their forms in history.

But what does this abstract theorising mean for space warfare? Space warfare – actions taken to destroy or interfere with enemy space systems – is not inherently escalatory, limited, ethical, a prelude to nuclear war, or inevitable. Space warfare will be a reflection of the political conditions of any belligerents that fight who happen to have a capability in using or denying space systems. Clausewitz, through stressing politics, brings the human element and the wider prevailing strategic context of any political violence to our attention. A recent series of articles on anti-satellite weapons and the risks of nuclear war fail to mention the realities of second-strike nuclear capabilities, the politics and psychology of nuclear threat perception, and the imponderable systemic political context that any single decision to attack will be within. Instead, select technological devices are ascribed a political value (stabilising or destabilising) without connecting the discussion to any political context between the established nuclear powers. These narrow arguments fail to adequately put space warfare in its strategic and political contexts and can impose blinkers on strategic thinking. Spacepower theory should help put these narrow arguments in their strategic contexts, and illuminate factors that have been omitted – in this case mutually assured destruction, second strike capabilities, and the politics and psychology of deterrence.

The second ground for analogy is that space warfare is best thought of as being comprised of as celestial lines of communication (a well-developed idea by John Klein ) and over the contest of a command of space. This of course is analogical to concepts of sea lines of communication and the command of the sea popularised by the seapower theorists Alfred Thayer Mahan and Julian Corbett. Along these lines or communication, information, wealth, and satellites travel either on Newtonian orbital paths or through data streams in the electromagnetic spectrum. Like sea lines of communication, denying the use of these celestial lines of communication may have an impact on a war. Indeed, the more an economy and military depends on those celestial lines of communication, the more lucrative a target those lines may become for an adversary. Though there are many problems by other authors on their use of seapower theory for spacepower theory, Mahan and Corbett, in conjunction with other lesser-known seapower thinkers make outer space more of a coastline than an open sea. Indeed, that is a central aspect of my spacepower theory. But, as Clausewitz and Mahan often argued, strategic creativity and good leadership escape quantitative analysis and defy mechanistic approaches to understanding war.

These two basic grounds of strategic analogy from warfare on Earth to outer space serve to illustrate how ‘Clausewitz in orbit’ works. But with such a qualitative approach, it is hard to declare success. Rather, only discussion and the academic process will deem spacepower theory of any use. Indeed, it is impossible for spacepower theory to be ‘correct’ – it can only be useful for the strategic education of the individual. This approach may be distasteful to some in an era of increasing quantitative analyses of educative practices and performance analysis.

By saying that war is political, I believe we can better see how thinking of space warfare must be mindful of Earthly politics and the human element. In this context, Clausewitz’s other concepts – of passion, reason, and chance, of friction, of the strategic defence being the stronger form of war – make more sense and become easier to apply critically to scenarios where our focus may be on what happens in Earth orbit and its interactions with terra firma. In a similar vein, when we use an analogy of celestial lines of communication and the command of space, it helps us to better think critically about other problems such as how decisive space power can ever be in war, what is the influence of spacepower upon (future) history, and how can belligerents respond to and learn from various forms of spacepower?

The critical application strategic analogies have led me to seven propositions of spacepower theory:

Space warfare is about the command of space

Space is a distinct geography but it is not isolated

Preponderance in space does not guarantee preponderance on Earth

The command of space is about exploiting celestial lines of communication

Earth orbit is a cosmic coastline

Spacepower finds itself in a geocentric mindset… and may outgrow it

Dispersion is a condition and effect of spacepower

These propositions show the headline outcomes of Clausewitz, et al., in orbit. As I near the end of my PhD research, I hope that my framework for spacepower theory helps take the next step in strategic thought about space, and to help understand more about astropolitics and questions of war and peace in orbit. Understanding the epistemology of strategic theory in a way that Clausewitz and Mahan did helps put limitations to my theory, but stresses their strengths and usefulness (see Jon Sumida’s Decoding Clausewitz and Inventing Grand Strategy and Teaching Command for discussions of this pedagogical approach to strategic theory).

It is necessary to finishing by stressing what strategic theory is not. Most strategic theory is not there to provide answers or axioms for success. In addition, knowing spacepower theory is not a prerequisite for good command judgment in space warfare. Neither is grasping spacepower theory a guarantee of making the best decisions. Strategic theory is meant to help an individual in one’s self-education on military-political matters by making problems more accessible to a reader in the absence ‘ genius .’ Spacepower theory should not only aim to make complex political matters over war and peace in space more comprehensible by grasping at the political roots of space warfare, but also to pave the way for an appreciation of creative and well-founded strategic thinking and command judgment in a realm so often dominated by technical or scientific mentalities.

This is what a Mahan for space is: distilling his Clausewitzian attitude to teaching command and strategy, and applying the seapower concepts of lines of communication to Earth orbit. With spacepower theory, outer space need not be such an undiscovered country.

Reblogged this on JDB Communications, LLC and commented: Probably overdue, though out of my zone.

Frau Clausewitz’s compilation of her dead husbands notes aside, the underpinning relationships in space are physics and well attested to by Dr Kessler. While ‘Gravity’ overstated the problem for cinematic values, the problems are real and space is not as much a ‘conflict domain’ as it is a ‘scarce natural resource’. Spacepower is a conceit that politics can trump physics and the ‘Darwin Awards’ celebrate similar conceits in other domains.

Interesting stuff, thanks for the post. I know that for several decades now, the USAF has struggled with developing a sound strategy for the employment of American space power. Have you looked at the theory of space power employment that places like SASS, AF Doctrine Center, and AFSPC (who has responsibility for organizing, training, and equipping space forces) have developed? I’m curious as to what big ideas they’ve come up with, and your take on them. That said, the whole “Mahan in space” approach has been tossed about for years, as well as silly ideas like “10 Propositions for Space Power” (a hijacking of the “10 Propositions for Airpower”) and a space organizational doctrine that is almost a carbon copy of air doctrine. The danger with the failure of (at least) the USAF to really think about this issue, as I see it, comes with a gross misreading of history. It thinks Mahan and Clausewitz contain the answers, but no one is really sure what the questions are. Americans, for example, have had a lots of trouble in defining the policy they want to take toward space warfare (for example, what is the US public policy on waging war in space — say kinetic ASAT attacks, or even e-attacks?) so unlike the RN and USN in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that had a farily clear naval policy on which to base a Mahanian strategy, the current space “warriors” have had a very hard time knowing what exactly they should be aiming for. But that problem is not a show stopper, even in time of a “space war.” Doctrine is just a political football, and it can be punted (American analogy here) with little cost when necessary. Warfighting, not so much. I contend that the real problem for the military space professional is the lack of an operational and tactical knoweldge base on how to “fight” in space. The USAF made some efforts in the late 90s and early 00s toward fixing this with the publication of some TTP documents (it tried to create a weapon system manual for space {AFTTP 3-1.28} just like there’s one for each airframe, and some other things under a program that can’t be named here, etc), but it quickly proved for naught when rice-bowl battles trumped the deep & revisionist thinking that the problem demanded. The USAF, for example, could not decide if space warfare was really glorified electronic aka information warfare, and vice versa; the concept of a Venn Diagram escaped it, so instead of moving forward and giving the warfighters something they could use, they produced nothing but some white papers that properly ended up in the shredder bin. Watching the “brain trust” try to create a Joint doctine for space power employment would have been comical if it hadn’t been so sad. After everyone spent their parochical bullets and then “agreed to disagree,” the Air Force decided it would just classify all its stuff so it did not have to talk with the other services about it, or anyone who wasn’t already indoctinated aka “read in” to the programs. So … what kind of obstacles have you encountered in trying to write an unclassified diss. on something that is classified out to Pluto and beyond? Trying to grapple with the problems of space warfare in a way becomes a Rumsfeldian (by the way, Rummy led the Blue Ribbon Panel on Space in the 21st Century just before he became Bush the Younger’s SECDEF, and had the bright idea that “Transformation” fueled by space power would allow the US to win in Iraq with far fewer troops that his field commanders said they needed) Catch-22: the Imperial You doesn’t know what You don’t know. How do you envision your doctrine, essentially your theory, informing how the US/UK/CAN/AUS wage the forthcoming space war against say the PRC or maybe the “space terrorists?” I really look forward to reading what you have to say. Cheers. PS please pardon typos; I used an iPad to type this.

Thanks very much for reading and for posting your comments! Thanks as well for your kind words. I have a few responses I hope you find interesting.

I have had the pleasure of meeting the people at SAASS, and I have looked at the published works of the authors there and some publically available essay work. They do good work, and I use it in the early stages of my spacepower theory. Your question becomes difficult to answer depending on what we mean by spacepower theory or doctrine. I believe they are two very different animals, but some people use those words interchangeably (as you seem to do at the end), and even then people have different opinions as to how they can be used and what kind of knowledge they represent. Hopefully the blog post explains well enough what kind of knowledge spacepower theory does. My spacepower theory is not a doctrine. It does not describe a military service’s mission roles, composition, duties, rules of engagement, advocate specific courses of action, institutional responsibilities, rules of best practice on deployment of specific equipment, etc.

Doctrine can be more than just a political football. Assuming you’re coming from a US perspective, I fully appreciate that statement! I’d recommend reading Hoiback’s work on doctrine, I found it very useful for my own study on doctrine and in teaching doctrine. I’m not as interested in space warfare doctrine because that’s an applied theoretical task for the needs of a specific military service at a specific time towards specific missions and contingencies, and often takes a more prescriptive or descriptive tone. My spacepower theory operates at a more universal level, presents what I think are universal problems in the conduct of space warfare and spacepower – not codes of best practice and categorisations of missions or roles (like some doctrine), but exploration of the possible given what we know about operating in space and exploiting it. This spacepower theory is for thinking about the politics of war in space (but the blog post above is more about the method and epistemology, rather than an exploration of my seven propositions).

Yes Mahan has been thrown around in space a lot. Corbett a few times, too! I don’t think they’ve been done well enough to my liking – others may disagree! What is difficult as well is when particular and contestable views of the theories from these thinkers are applied. In my thesis, my interpretation of Mahan differs considerably in some areas from others who have applied Mahan’s concepts to space. More importantly, I try to be as transparent as possible in the strategic analogies I make so that readers can follow them, and hopefully decide for themselves whether the interpretation and application of the theories are sound, or useful.

Your comments on Clausewitz and Mahan knowing the answers but we don’t know what the questions are – I think it’s the other way around. These classic thinkers do not have direct answers for us. They never did have answers to specific problems when they wrote about strategic theory (as opposed to actively advocating specific policies, like Mahan’s US fleet build-up or Clausewitz on Prussian resistance against France). Rather, thinkers like Clausewitz and Mahan have good questions or tools to help us ask good questions for us to find our own answers to specific problems. That is the purpose of strategic theory at its highest abstract level, I think. Paret said that theory is for study, and I believe a certain canon of strategic theories can help us study spacepower and space warfare, to come up with our own questions and answers based on the questions classic strategic theorists asked of the nature of war and politics. These seven propositions are tools to help study and consider the practice of spacepower.

You are absolutely right that we have little track record of space warfare – that’s why I resort to strategic analogies. We can still find useful thinking about war and peace in space from terrestrial experience. The way things are, we need to be thinking constructively about these things and increase the quality of strategic discussion on space, rather than wait for a war to happen and just hope that the right people will have given enough thought to how to do war in space. That’s relevant no matter which side of the Taiwan Strait you’re on, or whether or not you as a space user are on that Strait at all.

Electronic warfare is one means of many of going after celestial lines of communication, so space warfare is not just glorified EW, and EW is a different (but connected) thing to information warfare (assuming you mean cyber warfare?). Even so, EW against celestial lines of communication does demand space-specific knowledge on orbital physics and space technology.

I don’t know enough about the US’ inter-service politics when it comes to drafting spacepower (or doctrine?) documents – I’ll have to do some digging! Regardless, spacepower theory does not need the approval or acknowledgement of a military service (as an idea or a thing in its own right) to be valid in the field of strategic studies. Though it’d be nice, of course! People will still need to think about how spacepower fits into modern warfare at the highest strategic levels, therefore, I think spacepower theory will be useful to any who wish to do so, whether or not they’re in uniform and say in public that they do space warfare or not.

As for difficulties, once I knew I was doing spacepower theory, very few problems have come up in terms of classified information. Of course, I don’t know what I don’t know but those are generic epistemological problems. I can only use what I can find in the public domain, and since I’m not that concerned about the latest of the most sensitive space activities, and more concerned in creating a theory that educates about strategic thinking about spacepower, it wasn’t that much of a problem.

And yes, Rumsfeld and the Space Pearl Harbor. Never dull with him around. It’s impossible to escape the 2001 Space Commission when reading about American spacepower. Before transformation the buzzterm was RMA, and that’s addressed early on in my thesis as context-setting really. But my spacepower theory tries to get people to think about not just the exploitation of spacepower on Earth, but how it will be contested and denied. And we’d best have a good think about it even though we have little to no track record of a space denial or space control campaign between capable opponents.

As for your last question, I don’t know in detail. If it is to get any kind of attention in that regard, I’d only hope my theory provides practitioners with useful tidbits of strategic wisdom, like space warfare will reflect, and be a product of, the bigger politics at play on whatever the dispute is about on Earth. Space warfare is not isolated from Earthly politics. Additionally, I hope it can get people off the red herrings of space-based weapons and kinetic-kill weapons because they either don’t exist or are one of many options of taking out celestial lines of communication. Thanks to the works of Mahan, many strategists have a rough notion of how seapower, empire, and global trade works. I hope that spacepower theory can help people grasp the long-term universal fundamentals of how spacepower works in the context of politics and war in the modern political-economy that is stitched together by the space systems.

Thanks for your comments, excellent food for thought! I hope my responses are adequate.

Thanks so much for responding. Spacepower theory really isn’t my thing as a historian of the 18th century drawn to what Huw writes here, but it was cool ntl to read your stuff. It brought me back to my military days when I worked for an organization, back before the GWOT, focused on making sure US ground forces got all the support putatively available to them from the space assets “overhead.” One of the main issues I saw there was the chomping at the bit of the space community to be treated as more than a support arm of the combined arms/warfighting community. Frankly it was pathetic, but that’s a different story. The important thing, I think, for your work is that the “space cadets” could not in fact elucidate what they “brought to the fight.” They were obsessed with the weaponization of space, especially the PRC/PLA efforts to develop systems that would allow it to fight the “space war.” The cadets kept telling us that we would lose all our space-based ISR, navigation and positioning, and C2 capabilities. That would really suck to be sure, but it was real Chicken Little stuff. So there was talk about ASATs and killer satellites and defensive counter measures etc and relatively little effort to make sure the American sergant fireteam leader had the latest imagery of the bad guys’ entrenched positions over the hill. The cadets threw around a lot of Clausewitz and Mahan, but it was clear to me that very few of them ever read C & M other than the 2-paragraph synopsis that took off the internet: space is an American COG, we need to control the space choke points just like the RN cotrolled Gibralter and Singapore, we must have space supremacy [not just superiority], etc. Another biggie was “Space is a RMA,” but when I suggested that it might just be a MTR (because I knew they had never read Roberts or Parker and knew nothing of the work Soviet theorists had done on RMA/MTR) people looked at me like I was speaking a foreign language, which I think I was for a lot of the USAF theory and doctrine writers). That’s why I contend the US military space community has not asked the right questions and instead thinks it has the answers from the old dead white guys of the 19th century. The inch-deep/mile-wide theory was in place (hopefully you will change that), but the policy, strategy, and doctrine were absent. That’s why I think that separating theory from doctrine is a dangerous thing. Especially in the realm of space, where it is almost impossible to conduct exercises, all that remains are theories on which to base doctrine. Of course, there are wargames, but for space, those are essentially computer simulations, and as I watched several of them, it became clear to me that the wargames served as little more than a medium to build support for the acquisition of more space assets: SBIRS, space-based GMTI/AMTI platforms to “replace” AWACS/JSTARS, hyper-spectral imaging satellites to “find” hidden tanks that they enemy had protected with CCD, the list went on and on. I heard over and over again that space assets allowed the US military access to “denied territory” and would give us ‘information superiority” and “full-spectrum dominance,” but they never said who “we” were — see above about the sgt. fire-team leader. There were lots of theoretical buzzwords thrown about, but no one could answer the questions (the ones my PhD adviser pounded into my head) of “so what new here, and who cares?” In the end, I came to the conculsion that the US space community was a self-licking ice cream cone for a bunch of guys who had convinced themselves they were the “smartest guys in the room.” (I heard an USAF major general at the Space Operations Center at Vandenburg AFB actually announce that he indeed was the smartest guy in the room; as a lt col, I did not think it was my place to remind him that all the guys who came up with that saying ended up in prison, but I digress). Hopefully you can change that; I hope that somebody, somewhere, will use your theory to shape policies and strategy, and the US military in turn will use them to build a doctine of warfighting. I know, from what you said above, that that’s not really your intention, but I also think it’d be a shame if you did not peer into the gap (abyss?) between theory and doctrine. Of course, it’s your work, and I know how frustrating it can be when voices from the peanut gallery keep giving you “good ideas” as you try to finish your disseration. So, please take my insights for what they are worth (probably not much) and good luck with the diss. It’s back to the Seven Years’ War for me. Cheers :). PS please pardon typos as this is from an iPad.

Hi again. Thanks again for more comments (and for persisting through an iPad)! Very interesting to hear your perspective. I see what you mean now about the limitations of USAF’s approach to it and the (inter)service quirks. I hope that my finished thesis (and resulting book with any luck) can escape the gravity well of the USAF’s dominance (and to a lesser extent the critical mass inside the DC beltway) of spacepower theory/doctrine. I worry by getting into doctrine more I get too close to the egotistical battles of various bureaucracies, and the latest wishlists and pension schema of military services. The transition of space into a place where fighting or interference happens, or the ‘space segment’ being threatened should help more people outside of USAF see spacepower’s potential contribution to modern warfare and (grand) strategy. As for a supporting wing – that’s mostly it for spacepower. But reading Mahan’s ‘Influence’ book, I get the same impression about seapower. It boggles my mind how people can reduce Mahan’s ideas to only the big battle fleet and imposing a decisive battle.

I agree with you that Mahan and Clausewitz have only been engaged at a surface level (with some notable exceptions, though!). The space as a COG thing – it grinds my gears! Classic misuse of Carl’s concept in the way it’s usually presented.

At the end of the theory I hope there’s enough intellectual ammo for people to make the connections on how spacepower fits into wider political ends and economic gains (like Mahan does so well with his seapower history, I think).

Would it be possible for you to drop me a line at my email address – https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/interpol/staff/phd-students/bleddynbowen/ (my email addy is on there, rather not post it in the open here) – if you wouldn’t mind. I have some ideas on post-doc research and your experience and insight sounds like just what my research needs!

And the 7 years’ war is interesting! Though I know little of its history beyond Mahan and Kennedy, and playing through it in a certain computer game…

Trusting Little Minds with Big Subjects By Tracy Aitken

A common concern for potential homeschoolers and their loving families, ranking perhaps right after the number one concern of socialization, is math and science. “How,” they ask, “do you make sure they are getting what they need? Which curriculum do you choose? And what happens when they get to those upper years and Algebra, Physics, Calculus, Chemistry?”

This concern becomes almost frantic disbelief when one suggests they go without a curriculum. “What?! How do you teach math and science without textbooks? That may be well and good for the really little student, but by age 9 or 10 they need to have their times tables down. It’s the very foundation, the building blocks, of higher math. And Physics doesn’t just happen!”

As a life learner, I have to bite my tongue, since my first instinct is to answer, “If it doesn’t just ‘happen’, then why do they need to know it?” But in reality, this answer isn’t a comprehensive one. Nor will it successfully calm the fears of the family that is new to self-directed learning. As a society, we consider these subjects as big, reverent topics that require serious lengthy study. The fact of the matter, of course, is that it does just happen. Math and science just “happen” in our lives. Below are some examples from personal experience. Apologetically, all of my examples are from boys, because I have no daughters; please don’t consider this a gender study!

A five-year-old boy: “Mom, how old is the oldest person in your family?” Not at all an unusual question for a five-year-old, nor was his response when I told him my father was, at that point, 65 years old. “Wow, he is really old, I hope he doesn’t die soon!” I explained that Grandpa was in excellent shape. He still ran in competitive races (and won); he ate healthily; his weight was good, as was his blood pressure, blood sugar. Heck, Grandpa could live to be 100, I said, and that is 35 more years....that’s how old Mommy is! He could have a whole lifetime ahead of him, he – “But, Mom, he’d only be 90 in 35 years.” “No, he’s 65 now, in 35 years...” “But, Mom, three and six are nine, so 35 and 65 are 90.” So, with pencil and paper, Mom showed him how those two fives turned into a ten and that ten has to go somewhere, right? After a half-hour of successful carrying, my five-year-old asked me, “Does this work backwards?” In a single hour, my five-year-old mastered carrying and borrowing. Not only would he not have learned that in school yet, the school system had already announced that, because of his late birthday, my son wouldn’t even be eligible for kindergarten; he’d be in pre-kindergarten instead.

A seven-year-old boy, in the car: “Mom, how many miles is it from our house to the freeway?” “3.3 miles – Daddy measured it for his running course.” “Okay. Don’t talk.” We were driving to Aunt Deenie’s house at the time, with two younger brothers in the car. I’m not accustomed to being ordered not to talk by a seven-year-old, but, okay! While he’s thinking, let me tell you about the route to Aunt Deenie’s. We have to drive to one freeway, get on, get off and onto another freeway, get off that and get onto a third freeway, get off that onto a busy road (with exit numbers), then drive from there to Deenie’s house. “Mom, how many miles from Brian Parkway to Aunt Deenie’s driveway?” “About four, maybe?” I guess, surprised that he knew the name of that busy road. I’d be hard pressed to come up with the name myself. “Okay, don’t talk.” Then, presently, “Mom, it is 83.3 miles to Aunt Deenie’s house.” “How do you know that?” “Because,” he said, “We go 3.3 miles to the freeway, getting on at exit 36. We get off at exit 52, which is getting on at exit 151...” and so on and so on. It took me a bit of time (I’m afraid to compare the actual amount of time to the amount it took my son!) to discover that he was right.

A four-year-old boy, talking to Grandma on the phone: “Well, I fell down on the sidewalk and my skin rubbed against it the wrong way. The concrete rubbed away my skin layers and then my blood vessel broke, and the blood came out. That’s called bleeding. Bleeding is okay, it makes all the germs fall out, too. But blood vessels fix themselves fast, so it stopped bleeding. Now I have what they call a scrape on my knee.” After the phone call, I asked, “Where did you learn all that stuff about your scrape?” “[Big Brother] explained it to me.”

A six-year-old boy: “I heard [famous artist] had a stroke, Mom. Which side of his brain did he have the stroke on?” “I have no idea, honey.” “Well, I sure hope it wasn’t his left brain, because he’s probably right handed, and then he’d maybe not be able to draw anymore.”

As you can see, the question most asked in my house is “How do you know that?” I’m the one who is always asking it. In this case, the answer was, “We watched the Discovery channel last night for our bedtime story; it was about how the brain works.” My children will choose either a book, a short video/show, or a made-up story for their “bedtime story.” There’s no telling what they’ll choose; the previous night Daddy had put them to bed while I went out, so I was unaware of the choice.

A six-year-old boy: “When do we go on vacation?” “About three weeks.” “A week is seven days.” “Yes, it is.” “Let me think. That means, two weeks would be, um, 14 days?” “Yes.” “And so three weeks would be, hmmm, 21 days?” “Yes.” “Three weeks sounds like a long time, but 21 days sounds even longer!”

A nine-year-old boy: “Look at my new LEGO, Mom. It has remote control with a motor, and see what happens when you push this lever? And there’s a secret hiding place here. This hinge makes the leg go up to kick and over here, if you flip up his head....” “Wait. When did you get new LEGO?” I generally know when new toys are acquired, since I am the one with the checkbook. “Oh, this is just stuff from other LEGO I had left over.”

A twelve-year-old boy: “Mom, come listen to this song I made up on SimTunes.” “Wow, this is really good! Did you get the background picture from the gallery?” “No, I drew that. See, it’s a rainforest song. This part sounds like the rain and that part is the thunder. The guitar is supposed to be lightening; I guess it’s the closest sound lightening would make, sort of electric. And so the picture is of the rainforest. Want to see my other songs?” “I sure do!” “Okay, this one is a math song, see the background and how I used multiplication for the pattern? And this one is cyberspace; this one is Bionicle....”

By the age of six or seven, all three of my boys were familiar with solving for the unknown. I find I use rudimentary algebra on a fairly regular basis, and I think it is really a neat skill to have. Whenever I catch myself doing it, I show it to the closest boy; it’s a puzzle solved! Because I think it’s neat, they think it’s neat too (this technique works best, obviously, when they are still in the “Mom knows everything” stage.) And then when they need to find an unknown, they will show me how they did it.

While I can’t give you examples about physics and calculus (because I don’t use these enough to recognize them when I do), I know my boys have some basic knowledge of both. We have a lot of building/thinking games in our house, from Brio train sets that they put together in every possible permutation as very little boys (I know there is some physics in there, with the bridge building, etc.) to marble ramps, where they really have to calculate, or work trial and error, to get the proper angles and set up or the marble doesn’t run through. LEGO has been a major factor in our lives, of course. And all our computer games are educational in some way. I have purchased a lot of logic games so that the boys can stretch their minds. In a way, one may argue that these games are not part of “everyday life,” so shouldn’t count as an example...but the games are not being used to teach in a formal setting, so I will use the example for that reason.

While I doubt that my six-, nine-, and 13-year-old are ready for college prep courses (though perhaps the eldest is), I can argue confidently that they have strong foundations in math and science. I know that, should they choose a profession that requires heavy math or science skills, they will do well. Many times, people use cooking and grocery shopping as science and/or math examples. I don’t, because they are a “given,” as is money management, on the ice cream truck/allowance level. It may sound like my boys are science/math-minded but, actually, they are history buffs, as well as insatiable readers. Math and science are just what happen along the way!

A common concern for potential homeschoolers and their loving families, ranking perhaps right after the number one concern of socialization, is math and science. “How,” they ask, “do you make sure they are getting what they need? Which curriculum do you choose? And what happens when they get to those upper years and Algebra, Physics, Calculus, Chemistry?”

This concern becomes almost frantic disbelief when one suggests they go without a curriculum. “What?! How do you teach math and science without textbooks? That may be well and good for the really little student, but by age 9 or 10 they need to have their times tables down. It’s the very foundation, the building blocks, of higher math. And Physics doesn’t just happen!”

As a life learner, I have to bite my tongue, since my first instinct is to answer, “If it doesn’t just ‘happen’, then why do they need to know it?” But in reality, this answer isn’t a comprehensive one. Nor will it successfully calm the fears of the family that is new to self-directed learning. As a society, we consider these subjects as big, reverent topics that require serious lengthy study. The fact of the matter, of course, is that it does just happen. Math and science just “happen” in our lives. Below are some examples from personal experience. Apologetically, all of my examples are from boys, because I have no daughters; please don’t consider this a gender study!

A five-year-old boy: “Mom, how old is the oldest person in your family?” Not at all an unusual question for a five-year-old, nor was his response when I told him my father was, at that point, 65 years old. “Wow, he is really old, I hope he doesn’t die soon!” I explained that Grandpa was in excellent shape. He still ran in competitive races (and won); he ate healthily; his weight was good, as was his blood pressure, blood sugar. Heck, Grandpa could live to be 100, I said, and that is 35 more years....that’s how old Mommy is! He could have a whole lifetime ahead of him, he – “But, Mom, he’d only be 90 in 35 years.” “No, he’s 65 now, in 35 years...” “But, Mom, three and six are nine, so 35 and 65 are 90.” So, with pencil and paper, Mom showed him how those two fives turned into a ten and that ten has to go somewhere, right? After a half-hour of successful carrying, my five-year-old asked me, “Does this work backwards?” In a single hour, my five-year-old mastered carrying and borrowing. Not only would he not have learned that in school yet, the school system had already announced that, because of his late birthday, my son wouldn’t even be eligible for kindergarten; he’d be in pre-kindergarten instead.

A seven-year-old boy, in the car: “Mom, how many miles is it from our house to the freeway?” “3.3 miles – Daddy measured it for his running course.” “Okay. Don’t talk.” We were driving to Aunt Deenie’s house at the time, with two younger brothers in the car. I’m not accustomed to being ordered not to talk by a seven-year-old, but, okay! While he’s thinking, let me tell you about the route to Aunt Deenie’s. We have to drive to one freeway, get on, get off and onto another freeway, get off that and get onto a third freeway, get off that onto a busy road (with exit numbers), then drive from there to Deenie’s house. “Mom, how many miles from Brian Parkway to Aunt Deenie’s driveway?” “About four, maybe?” I guess, surprised that he knew the name of that busy road. I’d be hard pressed to come up with the name myself. “Okay, don’t talk.” Then, presently, “Mom, it is 83.3 miles to Aunt Deenie’s house.” “How do you know that?” “Because,” he said, “We go 3.3 miles to the freeway, getting on at exit 36. We get off at exit 52, which is getting on at exit 151...” and so on and so on. It took me a bit of time (I’m afraid to compare the actual amount of time to the amount it took my son!) to discover that he was right.

A four-year-old boy, talking to Grandma on the phone: “Well, I fell down on the sidewalk and my skin rubbed against it the wrong way. The concrete rubbed away my skin layers and then my blood vessel broke, and the blood came out. That’s called bleeding. Bleeding is okay, it makes all the germs fall out, too. But blood vessels fix themselves fast, so it stopped bleeding. Now I have what they call a scrape on my knee.” After the phone call, I asked, “Where did you learn all that stuff about your scrape?” “[Big Brother] explained it to me.”

A six-year-old boy: “I heard [famous artist] had a stroke, Mom. Which side of his brain did he have the stroke on?” “I have no idea, honey.” “Well, I sure hope it wasn’t his left brain, because he’s probably right handed, and then he’d maybe not be able to draw anymore.”

As you can see, the question most asked in my house is “How do you know that?” I’m the one who is always asking it. In this case, the answer was, “We watched the Discovery channel last night for our bedtime story; it was about how the brain works.” My children will choose either a book, a short video/show, or a made-up story for their “bedtime story.” There’s no telling what they’ll choose; the previous night Daddy had put them to bed while I went out, so I was unaware of the choice.

A six-year-old boy: “When do we go on vacation?” “About three weeks.” “A week is seven days.” “Yes, it is.” “Let me think. That means, two weeks would be, um, 14 days?” “Yes.” “And so three weeks would be, hmmm, 21 days?” “Yes.” “Three weeks sounds like a long time, but 21 days sounds even longer!”

A nine-year-old boy: “Look at my new LEGO, Mom. It has remote control with a motor, and see what happens when you push this lever? And there’s a secret hiding place here. This hinge makes the leg go up to kick and over here, if you flip up his head....” “Wait. When did you get new LEGO?” I generally know when new toys are acquired, since I am the one with the checkbook. “Oh, this is just stuff from other LEGO I had left over.”

A twelve-year-old boy: “Mom, come listen to this song I made up on SimTunes.” “Wow, this is really good! Did you get the background picture from the gallery?” “No, I drew that. See, it’s a rainforest song. This part sounds like the rain and that part is the thunder. The guitar is supposed to be lightening; I guess it’s the closest sound lightening would make, sort of electric. And so the picture is of the rainforest. Want to see my other songs?” “I sure do!” “Okay, this one is a math song, see the background and how I used multiplication for the pattern? And this one is cyberspace; this one is Bionicle....”

By the age of six or seven, all three of my boys were familiar with solving for the unknown. I find I use rudimentary algebra on a fairly regular basis, and I think it is really a neat skill to have. Whenever I catch myself doing it, I show it to the closest boy; it’s a puzzle solved! Because I think it’s neat, they think it’s neat too (this technique works best, obviously, when they are still in the “Mom knows everything” stage.) And then when they need to find an unknown, they will show me how they did it.

While I can’t give you examples about physics and calculus (because I don’t use these enough to recognize them when I do), I know my boys have some basic knowledge of both. We have a lot of building/thinking games in our house, from Brio train sets that they put together in every possible permutation as very little boys (I know there is some physics in there, with the bridge building, etc.) to marble ramps, where they really have to calculate, or work trial and error, to get the proper angles and set up or the marble doesn’t run through.

Tips for Keeping Your Pup Healthy in the Winter

January 16, 2023

With winter here, we all know the challenges of staying warm and safe. We must also take into consideration the well-being of our pets as the temperature drops. Here are a few simple tips you can take to make sure your fur-legged friend stays warm, comfortable, and healthy this winter season.

Keep a Time Limit on How Long Your Pup is Outside

The key is monitoring your pup and making sure he is not left outside for more than a few minutes at a time. Things such as frostbite can set in quickly, which can be very painful for your dog. Watch his behavior while outside, and if he begins to slow down or shiver, it’s time to bring him in. Dogs do love the outdoors but have limitations, just like we do.

Bundle Your Pup Up

Yes, most dogs have thick coats, which will help keep them somewhat warm, but a second layer of insulation, such as a dog jacket or sweater, will help keep your pup warmer. Many pet stores carry insulated jackets which will prevent your dog from losing heat. This is especially important for dog breeds that have a thin coat and or are not designed to withstand cold weather.

Consider Your Pup’s Age and General Activity Level

Young puppies and senior dogs tend to have more of a difficult time in cold weather. Although puppies love to play in the snow, they do not always know their limits and can find themselves in over their head (no pun intended) when a significant amount of snow falls. Dogs between two years of age and eight years of age tend to handle the cold weather better than puppies or senior pups.

Keep Your Dog’s Paws Protected

Dogs have very sensitive and vulnerable paws, which is why keeping their paws safe is important. Dog booties offer a layer of protection between your pup’s paws and the harsh ground. Ice and snow can quickly irritate the pads on your dog’s paws. Other things, such as rock salt, which is used in the winter, can also greatly irritate his paws. Doggy booties are an inexpensive yet effective way to keep your pup feeling his best while outside in the winter. They may take some time to get used to, but they are well worth it.

Heating Beds for After Playtime

After your pup comes in, he will need to warm up. Providing your pup with a dog heating bed is a great way to help bring his body temperature up to where it needs to be. This will also help your four-legged friend relax and rest after exerting himself while outside. Several dog heating beds come with an automatic shutoff feature for safety. If a heating bed is out of your price range, consider a dog heating pad. This less expensive item will also allow your dog to warm up after being outside in the freezing weather.

Hydrate Your Dog After Playtime

Dogs do not only need extra water after playing in the warm months. Cold winter days will also require your pup to stay well hydrated. When the moisture in the air drops (as it often does) in the winter, your dog will need proper hydration. Providing your dog with ample amounts of room-temperature water when he returns inside will help keep him feeling his best.

Clean His Paws

If you opt not to use dog booties, be sure to make sure his paws are wiped down when he comes in. Rock salt and other anti-ice agents may cause your pup’s paws to be in discomfort. Wiping them down will help to remove whatever he gets on them, plus it will prevent him from licking the substance off of his paws. This very quick and very easy chore will greatly benefit your dog.

We all love our dogs, and by taking a few simple precautions, we can ensure that they remain in top condition and feel great all winter long. Always remember, if it’s too cold for you to be outside, it is probably too cold for your dog to be outside. Taking the time to make sure your pup is comfortable and safe is always very important.

What is Oral Turinabol ( Oral Tbol ) Powder ?

Oral Turinabol Powder is a well known anabolic steroid. It is actually a Dianobol (a dehydro version of testosterone) with a 4- chloro modification and commonly called Oral Tbol Powder. Its chemical name is 4-chlorodehydrometyltestosterone. It was developed by the scientists in East Germany and became popular due to its recent release by British Dragon.

Unlike other androgenic anabolic steroids that must be injected, oral Turinabol (Oral Tbol) can be taken orally. Oral Turinabol (Oral Tbol) is available in Powder, capsule, and pill form, with pills being the most common. The characteristics of oral Turinabol Powder are frequently described as being midway between Dianabol and Anavar.

How does Oral Turinabol work?

Turinabol Powder works by increasing protein synthesis in cells, which implies it contributes to muscle growth over time. This steroid helps to reduce the amount of glucocorticoid hormones produced by your body, which means it can also assist prevent muscle loss while you’re not training. Turinabol Powder provides these benefits while avoiding difficulties such as estrogen conversion because it helps to increase testosterone levels in your body.

What are the benefits of Oral Turinabol Powder?

You may start your cycle with confidence once you know how much Oral Turinabol Powder to take and for how long! Oral Tbol Powder may assist you in creating larger muscles, increasing your strength, and improving your performance. The importance is to buy real oral Turinabol Powder from reliable supplier so you can get the best maximum results from it.

A few of the other benefits you can expect to see include:

①Oral Turinabol Powder benefits to enhance Stamina and Endurance

You will feel less weary during intense activities after around two weeks of your five-week oral Tbol cycle at the recommended daily dosage of 80mg.

Your recuperation time after each strenuous exercise would also improve dramatically.

Instead of training two to three days a week, you could work out at a high level for six days straight.

②Oral Turinabol Powder benefits to Boost the Muscle Growth

One of the primary functions of Oral Turinabol Powder is to promote muscular growth. For this reason, it is extremely popular among bodybuilders. Athletic performance is primarily dependent on strength, which can be developed via larger and stronger muscles.

Oral Tbol Powder may be similar to Dianabol, but it may be just as effective as a bulking agent in most circumstances. Your muscles grow more obvious after the second week of your five-week Oral Turinabol cycle. The benefit of this substance is that it constantly pumps up your muscles. The disadvantage is that it may cause pain in some bodybuilders.

Even when you’re not doing rigorous workouts, your calf and back muscles pump up to an incredible level.

③Oral Turinabol Powder benefits to Increase Muscle Dryness and Vascularity

In addition to pumping up your muscles, Oral Turinabol Powder will not fill out your muscles with water, as is the case with Dianabol. Instead your muscles become dry and more vascular in nature.

This usually starts from the second week of use, when your veins become more visible as your muscles pump up.

By the third or fourth week, the level of your muscle vascularity would increase, but not to ridiculous levels (so don’t worry).

④Oral Turinabol Powder benefits to Cutting Cycle

A number of people use Oral Turinabol Powder during the bulking cycle while some of them might have used it during the cutting cycle.

It is because Oral Turinabol Powder tries to play a vital role in helping your metabolism. As the body burns up the calories at a rapid pace, hence the body could have the capacity to burn the fat cells to fuel the workout efforts during the cutting cycle.

Unlike other steroids, the Oral Turinabol Powder may act as a versatile anabolic steroid, that could be used for both bulking and cutting.

⑤Oral Turinabol Powder benefits to Leaner Muscles

Similar to other steroids, Oral Tbol Powder helps bodybuilders to gain muscle mass. In order to help you to gain leaner muscles, Oral Turinabol Powder will enhance the retention of nitrogen in the muscles while also increasing the RBC as well as protein synthesis.

Unlike Dianabol which causes you to retain large volumes of water, Oral Tbol Powder will not cause you to be bloated up.

⑥Oral Turinabol Powder benefits to Enhance Mood

One other positive effect of Oral Turinabol Powder is that it helps to enhance your mood. That uplifting feeling that you need in order to put in the time required to complete your workout session is very important.

If you are not in the right frame of mind to engage in a training session, you will find it difficult to succeed as a bodybuilder.

However, by running a Oral Turinabol cycle, your mood is enhanced and you are better able to workout with the enthusiasm needed to succeed in bodybuilding.

⑦Oral Bio-availability

Since Oral Turinabol Powder is an oral steroid, you can simply swallow it with water. Oral Turinabol tablets are available in the size of pills and there’s no need to inject them into your blood. To buy the Oral Turinabol in the Powder form, you can buy from Oral Turinabol Powder supplier. You can buy oral Turinabol Powder bulk to get the good price.

⑧Prevent from Gynecomastia and other benefits.

Though it is a derivative of Dianabol (Dbol), Oral Turinabol Powder is not aromatized into estrogen. As such, you don’t have to worry about the side effects of aromatization, including:

Enlarged breast tissue (gynecomastia)

Water retention

Insomnia

High blood pressure

Low libido

Oral Turinabol Powder side effects

Many consumers believe that Oral Turinabol Powder is less risky than dianabol. However, it has its side effects, which are as follows:

Androgenic side effects – such as acne and hair loss in men although not noticeable and virilization in women if a high dose is taken

Increased bad cholesterol and lowered good cholesterol

Testosterone suppression as per the duration, dose, and other steroids in the cycle

Direct correlation between cycle length and dose and liver damage

Mood Swings – Similar to alcohol, oral Turinabol powder may have an impact on your mood. The most frequent adverse effect of all steroids is mood swings, and Oral Tbol Powder is no exception. As expected from how steroids will impact individuals, all of these mood swings are caused by the hormone. Like a few drunks, you can become more hostile and unpleasant.

Oily Skin -Despite being considerably less androgenic than other anabolic steroids, oral Turinabol powder may nevertheless have androgenic adverse effects. The negative effects could be from the greater doses or from your unique sensitivity to this kind. Oral Turinabol Powder may also increase sebum secretion, which could result in greasy skin and severe acne.

Other Oral Turinabol Powder side effects

The most common additional androgenic side effects include male pattern baldness and excessive body hair growth, particularly on the back.

According to the FDA, such goods could be extremely hazardous to your health. It is normally recommended that you utilize legal steroids or some of the greatest SARMs alternatives, which can be a terrific alternative to anabolic steroids.

How much Oral Tbol Powder should you take every day? Oral Turinabol Powder dosage?

As it’s been used for decades to improve athletic performance, researchers now know the levels of Oral Turinabol Powder that should be administered to achieve peak results. They know that an average dosage is between 20 and 50 mg, with exact amounts varying based on individual circumstances.

As such, it’s possible to discern the most effective amount you can take. This helps reduce the risk of accidentally ingesting more than your recommended amount.

Most first-time users belonging to the field of bodybuilding prefer starting with 20 mg a day for a four-week cycle. A more experienced steroid user may consume up to 50 mg per day for six weeks.

You need to be careful and find out what works for you and your goal. It is wise to start with a lower dose instead of a higher one. Different dosages are recommended for men and women, which are as follows:

Beginners: 30 to 40 mg a day

Intermediate: 50 to 80 mg a day

Advanced Bodybuilders: 80 to 100 mg a day at least

Females: 5 to 10 mg a day (this is also general medial dose range)

Note: The actual Oral Turinabol Powder dosage for you depends on how tolerant your body is to this steroid. Just keep in mind that a higher dosage means more risk of experiencing the side effects.

Best Oral Turinabol Powder Cycles with Other Steroids

While some athletes choose to take Turinabol on its own, it is also available in a variety of stacks with other anabolic steroids. Here are some of the most popular stacks and Oral Turinabol Powder cycles for building strength and lean muscle growth without adding too much water or fat.

①Oral Turinabol Powder Bulking Stacks:

Anadrol – which is another popular bulking steroid; this oral steroid is superior to Dianabol and Anadrol in that it allows you to gain 30 to 40 pounds of muscle mass in just a few weeks.

Dianabol – one of the most potent bulking steroids available It’s regarded as the king of all muscle-building steroids because it works quickly and produces incredible gains in strength and muscle growth.

Anavar – Because it has fewer side effects than other anabolic steroids, this oral steroid is gaining favor among athletes; some bodybuilders utilize it as a stepping stone to the more powerful Dianabol and Tbol.

②Oral Turinabol Powder Cutting Stacks:

Winstrol (Stanozolol) – This injectable steroid is particularly popular among bodybuilders who are on cutting cycles since it allows them to keep lean muscle mass while burning fat. This stack’s effects include increased muscle firmness and a more defined body.

Anavar (Oxandrolone) – Anavar, as you are surely aware, also aids in fat loss while preserving muscle mass. It’s a safer alternative to other cutting steroids and a popular stacking option for people looking to get the most out of their Turinabol cycles.

Masteron (Drostanolone Propionate) – This is another injectable steroid that will work well in a cycle with Turinabol. The benefits of Masteron include gaining high-quality, lean muscular mass. By beginning the cycle with Turinabol, these Masteron benefits will be amplified.

③Turinabol PCT Stacks:

HCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin) – During post-cycle therapy, this injectable hormone will assist you in maintaining your muscle mass by preventing testicular shrinkage and lowering estrogen levels.

Clomid – Clomid is the most commonly utilized PCT medicine for resuming natural testosterone production following a Turinabol cycle. It’s also quite efficient at combating steroid side effects like gyno, oily skin, acne, and so on.

Oral Turinabol Powder is one of the most potent oral anabolic steroids on the market, providing incredible results when coupled with other steroids in stacks. It’s very popular among weightlifters and bodybuilders because it can be used alone or in combination with other anabolic supplements to support various goals, such as gaining strength quickly, losing fat while retaining lean muscle mass, or increasing lean muscle mass without excessive water retention or fat gains.

One have to be aware of is that nowadays you can buy Oral Turinabol Powder easily, multiple steroid powder supplier sell it online. It is important to find the reliable steroid powder factory. The Oral Turinabol Powder manufacturer such as AASRAW can wholesale supply Oral Turinabol Powder with most competitive price.

Oral Turinabol Powder Post Cycle Therapy (PCT)

Some may recommend using Oral Tbol Powder without PCT. However, we must realize that without a PCT, testosterone levels may not return to normal. As a result, there should be no space for error.

PCT usually consists of two weeks of Clomid or a modest Nolvadex daily dosage (20 mg). Depending on the other substances used to stack oral Turinabol Powder and their effectiveness in reducing testosterone in the body, introducing Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) may be a prudent step.

The length of your PCT is determined by the other steroids you have used. It is usually for a duration of four to six weeks. Because oral Turinabol Powder is relatively weak and non-aromatizable, aromatase inhibitors are not required.

Oral Turinabol Powder vs Anavar

Oral Turinabol Powder and Anavar are similar, with both of them being orals and non-estrogenic compounds.

They both promote lean muscle mass, strength gains and fat loss.

However, oral Turinabol’s effects are believed to be slightly more pronounced compared to Anavar, thus Oral Tbol may have an edge in terms of muscle and strength gains.

On the flip side, Oral Turinabol may cause slightly more side effects than Anavar, such as higher fluctuations in cholesterol, ALT/AST liver enzymes and further testosterone suppression.

Some users suggest that Oral Turinabol causes less synovial fluid dehydration, thus being more joint-friendly than Anavar (and Winstrol). This may be of interest to bodybuilders who perform fewer repetitions, lifting heavier weights.

Anavar is a female-friendly steroid that rarely produces virilization effects, and the same may be true for Turinabol.

However, due to Turinabol’s slightly more potent nature, it is fair to assume that Anavar is a safer compound for women. Since Anavar’s creation in 1962, there is more research available regarding its effects on women; plus it continues to be used in medicine today.

Oral Turinabol Powder however is not FDA-approved to treat any catabolic illness and is seldom taken by female weightlifters; making it a less understood compound.

Oral Turinabol Powder vs dianabol

Oral Turinabol Powder is a Dianabol derivative, but it is more than just a weaker form of the more popular steroid; it has its own qualities and uses. As a lesser steroid, the chances of adverse effects are less severe and less likely overall. When bodybuilding, using Oral Turinabol Powder may boost your strength and muscle mass, but because to its weaker nature, you will most likely need to start on a moderate dosage to get effects, rather than starting as low as feasible.

Oral Turinabol Powder for sale – Where to buy Oral Tbol Powder?

Oral Turinabol Powder is widely available on the internet. However, a high level of purity must be ensured in order to achieve the desired benefits. Consider Oral Tbol Powder customer reviews to learn about the top Oral Turinabol Powder

Oral Turinabol ( Oral Tbol ) Powder Testing Report-HNMR

What is HNMR and What does HNMR spectrum tell you? H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is an analytical chemistry technique used in quality control and research for determining the content and purity of a sample as well as its molecular structure. For example, NMR can quantitatively analyze mixtures containing known compounds. For unknown compounds, NMR can either be used to match against spectral libraries or to infer the basic structure directly. Once the basic structure is known, NMR can be used to determine molecular conformation in solution as well as studying physical properties at the molecular level such as conformational exchange, phase changes, solubility, and diffusion.

Oral Turinabol Powder is a well known anabolic steroid. It is actually a Dianobol (a dehydro version of testosterone) with a 4- chloro modification and commonly called Oral Tbol Powder. Its chemical name is 4-chlorodehydrometyltestosterone. It was developed by the scientists in East Germany and became popular due to its recent release by British Dragon.

Unlike other androgenic anabolic steroids that must be injected, oral Turinabol (Oral Tbol) can be taken orally. Oral Turinabol (Oral Tbol) is available in Powder, capsule, and pill form, with pills being the most common. The characteristics of oral Turinabol Powder are frequently described as being midway between Dianabol and Anavar.

Turinabol Powder works by increasing protein synthesis in cells, which implies it contributes to muscle growth over time. This steroid helps to reduce the amount of glucocorticoid hormones produced by your body, which means it can also assist prevent muscle loss while you’re not training. Turinabol Powder provides these benefits while avoiding difficulties such as estrogen conversion because it helps to increase testosterone levels in your body.

What are the benefits of Oral Turinabol Powder?

You may start your cycle with confidence once you know how much Oral Turinabol Powder to take and for how long! Oral Tbol Powder may assist you in creating larger muscles, increasing your strength, and improving your performance. The importance is to buy real oral Turinabol Powder from reliable supplier so you can get the best maximum results from it.

A few of the other benefits you can expect to see include:

①Oral Turinabol Powder benefits to enhance Stamina and Endurance

You will feel less weary during intense activities after around two weeks of your five-week oral Tbol cycle at the recommended daily dosage of 80mg.

Your recuperation time after each strenuous exercise would also improve dramatically.

Instead of training two to three days a week, you could work out at a high level for six days straight.

②Oral Turinabol Powder benefits to Boost the Muscle Growth

One of the primary functions of Oral Turinabol Powder is to promote muscular growth. For this reason, it is extremely popular among bodybuilders. Athletic performance is primarily dependent on strength, which can be developed via larger and stronger muscles.

Oral Tbol Powder may be similar to Dianabol, but it may be just as effective as a bulking agent in most circumstances. Your muscles grow more obvious after the second week of your five-week Oral Turinabol cycle. The benefit of this substance is that it constantly pumps up your muscles. The disadvantage is that it may cause pain in some bodybuilders.

Even when you’re not doing rigorous workouts, your calf and back muscles pump up to an incredible level.

③Oral Turinabol Powder benefits to Increase Muscle Dryness and Vascularity

In addition to pumping up your muscles, Oral Turinabol Powder will not fill out your muscles with water, as is the case with Dianabol. Instead your muscles become dry and more vascular in nature.

This usually starts from the second week of use, when your veins become more visible as your muscles pump up.

By the third or fourth week, the level of your muscle vascularity would increase, but not to ridiculous levels (so don’t worry).

A number of people use Oral Turinabol Powder during the bulking cycle while some of them might have used it during the cutting cycle.

It is because Oral Turinabol Powder tries to play a vital role in helping your metabolism. As the body burns up the calories at a rapid pace, hence the body could have the capacity to burn the fat cells to fuel the workout efforts during the cutting cycle.

Unlike other steroids, the Oral Turinabol Powder may act as a versatile anabolic steroid, that could be used for both bulking and cutting.

Similar to other steroids, Oral Tbol Powder helps bodybuilders to gain muscle mass. In order to help you to gain leaner muscles, Oral Turinabol Powder will enhance the retention of nitrogen in the muscles while also increasing the RBC as well as protein synthesis.

Unlike Dianabol which causes you to retain large volumes of water, Oral Tbol Powder will not cause you to be bloated up.

One other positive effect of Oral Turinabol Powder is that it helps to enhance your mood. That uplifting feeling that you need in order to put in the time required to complete your workout session is very important.

If you are not in the right frame of mind to engage in a training session, you will find it difficult to succeed as a bodybuilder.

However, by running a Oral Turinabol cycle, your mood is enhanced and you are better able to workout with the enthusiasm needed to succeed in bodybuilding.

Since Oral Turinabol Powder is an oral steroid, you can simply swallow it with water. Oral Turinabol tablets are available in the size of pills and there’s no need to inject them into your blood. To buy the Oral Turinabol in the Powder form, you can buy from Oral Turinabol Powder supplier. You can buy oral Turinabol Powder bulk to get the good price.

⑧Prevent from Gynecomastia and other benefits.

Though it is a derivative of Dianabol (Dbol), Oral Turinabol Powder is not aromatized into estrogen. As such, you don’t have to worry about the side effects of aromatization, including:

Many consumers believe that Oral Turinabol Powder is less risky than dianabol. However, it has its side effects, which are as follows:

Androgenic side effects – such as acne and hair loss in men although not noticeable and virilization in women if a high dose is taken

Testosterone suppression as per the duration, dose, and other steroids in the cycle

Direct correlation between cycle length and dose and liver damage

Mood Swings – Similar to alcohol, oral Turinabol powder may have an impact on your mood. The most frequent adverse effect of all steroids is mood swings, and Oral Tbol Powder is no exception. As expected from how steroids will impact individuals, all of these mood swings are caused by the hormone. Like a few drunks, you can become more hostile and unpleasant.

Oily Skin -Despite being considerably less androgenic than other anabolic steroids, oral Turinabol powder may nevertheless have androgenic adverse effects. The negative effects could be from the greater doses or from your unique sensitivity to this kind. Oral Turinabol Powder may also increase sebum secretion, which could result in greasy skin and severe acne.

The most common additional androgenic side effects include male pattern baldness and excessive body hair growth, particularly on the back.

According to the FDA, such goods could be extremely hazardous to your health. It is normally recommended that you utilize legal steroids or some of the greatest SARMs alternatives, which can be a terrific alternative to anabolic steroids.

How much Oral Tbol Powder should you take every day? Oral Turinabol Powder dosage?

As it’s been used for decades to improve athletic performance, researchers now know the levels of Oral Turinabol Powder that should be administered to achieve peak results. They know that an average dosage is between 20 and 50 mg, with exact amounts varying based on individual circumstances.

As such, it’s possible to discern the most effective amount you can take. This helps reduce the risk of accidentally ingesting more than your recommended amount.

Most first-time users belonging to the field of bodybuilding prefer starting with 20 mg a day for a four-week cycle. A more experienced steroid user may consume up to 50 mg per day for six weeks.

You need to be careful and find out what works for you and your goal. It is wise to start with a lower dose instead of a higher one. Different dosages are recommended for men and women, which are as follows:

Beginners: 30 to 40 mg a day

Intermediate: 50 to 80 mg a day

Advanced Bodybuilders: 80 to 100 mg a day at least

Females: 5 to 10 mg a day (this is also general medial dose range)

Note: The actual Oral Turinabol Powder dosage for you depends on how tolerant your body is to this steroid. Just keep in mind that a higher dosage means more risk of experiencing the side effects.

While some athletes choose to take Turinabol on its own, it is also available in a variety of stacks with other anabolic steroids. Here are some of the most popular stacks and Oral Turinabol Powder cycles for building strength and lean muscle growth without adding too much water or fat.

Anadrol – which is another popular bulking steroid; this oral steroid is superior to Dianabol and Anadrol in that it allows you to gain 30 to 40 pounds of muscle mass in just a few weeks.

Dianabol – one of the most potent bulking steroids available It’s regarded as the king of all muscle-building steroids because it works quickly and produces incredible gains in strength and muscle growth.

Anavar – Because it has fewer side effects than other anabolic steroids, this oral steroid is gaining favor among athletes; some bodybuilders utilize it as a stepping stone to the more powerful Dianabol and Tbol.

Winstrol (Stanozolol) – This injectable steroid is particularly popular among bodybuilders who are on cutting cycles since it allows them to keep lean muscle mass while burning fat. This stack’s effects include increased muscle firmness and a more defined body.

Anavar (Oxandrolone) – Anavar, as you are surely aware, also aids in fat loss while preserving muscle mass. It’s a safer alternative to other cutting steroids and a popular stacking option for people looking to get the most out of their Turinabol cycles.

Masteron (Drostanolone Propionate) – This is another injectable steroid that will work well in a cycle with Turinabol. The benefits of Masteron include gaining high-quality, lean muscular mass. By beginning the cycle with Turinabol, these Masteron benefits will be amplified.

HCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin) – During post-cycle therapy, this injectable hormone will assist you in maintaining your muscle mass by preventing testicular shrinkage and lowering estrogen levels.

Clomid – Clomid is the most commonly utilized PCT medicine for resuming natural testosterone production following a Turinabol cycle. It’s also quite efficient at combating steroid side effects like gyno, oily skin, acne, and so on.

Oral Turinabol Powder is one of the most potent oral anabolic steroids on the market, providing incredible results when coupled with other steroids in stacks. It’s very popular among weightlifters and bodybuilders because it can be used alone or in combination with other anabolic supplements to support various goals, such as gaining strength quickly, losing fat while retaining lean muscle mass, or increasing lean muscle mass without excessive water retention or fat gains.

One have to be aware of is that nowadays you can buy Oral Turinabol Powder easily, multiple steroid powder supplier sell it online. It is important to find the reliable steroid powder factory. The Oral Turinabol Powder manufacturer such as AASRAW can wholesale supply Oral Turinabol Powder with most competitive price.

Some may recommend using Oral Tbol Powder without PCT. However, we must realize that without a PCT, testosterone levels may not return to normal. As a result, there should be no space for error.

PCT usually consists of two weeks of Clomid or a modest Nolvadex daily dosage (20 mg). Depending on the other substances used to stack oral Turinabol Powder and their effectiveness in reducing testosterone in the body, introducing Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) may be a prudent step.

The length of your PCT is determined by the other steroids you have used. It is usually for a duration of four to six weeks. Because oral Turinabol Powder is relatively weak and non-aromatizable, aromatase inhibitors are not required.

Oral Turinabol Powder and Anavar are similar, with both of them being orals and non-estrogenic compounds.

They both promote lean muscle mass, strength gains and fat loss.

However, oral Turinabol’s effects are believed to be slightly more pronounced compared to Anavar, thus Oral Tbol may have an edge in terms of muscle and strength gains.

On the flip side, Oral Turinabol may cause slightly more side effects than Anavar, such as higher fluctuations in cholesterol, ALT/AST liver enzymes and further testosterone suppression.

Some users suggest that Oral Turinabol causes less synovial fluid dehydration, thus being more joint-friendly than Anavar (and Winstrol). This may be of interest to bodybuilders who perform fewer repetitions, lifting heavier weights.

Anavar is a female-friendly steroid that rarely produces virilization effects, and the same may be true for Turinabol.

However, due to Turinabol’s slightly more potent nature, it is fair to assume that Anavar is a safer compound for women. Since Anavar’s creation in 1962, there is more research available regarding its effects on women; plus it continues to be used in medicine today.

Oral Turinabol Powder however is not FDA-approved to treat any catabolic illness and is seldom taken by female weightlifters; making it a less understood compound.

Oral Turinabol Powder is a Dianabol derivative, but it is more than just a weaker form of the more popular steroid; it has its own qualities and uses. As a lesser steroid, the chances of adverse effects are less severe and less likely overall. When bodybuilding, using Oral Turinabol Powder may boost your strength and muscle mass, but because to its weaker nature, you will most likely need to start on a moderate dosage to get effects, rather than starting as low as feasible.

What is HNMR and What does HNMR spectrum tell you? H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is an analytical chemistry technique used in quality control and research for determining the content and purity of a sample as well as its molecular structure. For example, NMR can quantitatively analyze mixtures containing known compounds. For unknown compounds, NMR can either be used to match against spectral libraries or to infer the basic structure directly. Once the basic structure is known, NMR can be used to determine molecular conformation in solution as well as studying physical properties at the molecular level such as conformational exchange, phase changes, solubility, and diffusion.

On the Modern Cult of the Factish Gods

Date: April 2009 Publisher: Duke University Press Translator(s): Heather MacLean and Cathy Porter Language: English ISBN: 978-0199256051

Description

Belief is not a state of mind, but a result of the relationships between peoples; this has been known since Montaigne. The visitor knows, the visited believes; or quite the opposite, the visitor knew, the visited makes him understand that he only thought he knew. Let us apply this principle to the case of the Moderns. Everywhere they drop anchor they soon put up fetishes, that is to say that in all the peoples they encounter, they see worshippers of objects that are nothing. Since of course the Moderns have to explain away the strangeness of a worship that cannot be justified objectively, they endow the savages with a mental state that has internal instead of external references. As the wave of colonization advances, so does the world fill with believers. He who is modern believes what others believe. On the contrary, the agnostic does not ask himself whether to believe or not, but why the Moderns need belief so much before they can have a relationship with others.

Thinking in 10x and Other Google Directives

Alex Woodie

When Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin set up shop in Susan Wojcicki’s garage in Menlo Park 15 years ago, they had a fairly straightforward plan: Organize and make useful all of the world’s information. That may have been the company’s first example of 10x thinking, according to Patrick Pichette, the company’s CFO, but it certainly was not–and won’t be–the last.

Pichette recently spoke to a group of graduate students at the Tuck School of Business at DartmouthCollege on the power of Google’s 10x thinking. Thinking in 10x doesn’t come easy to most people, who would gladly take a 10 to 15 percent improvement in something, says Pichette, who is also a senior vice president with the Internet giant.

“They think they can save more money, they think they can increase profits, they think they can get their next version…out. That’s the essence of what I see around the world around me: 10 and 15 percent improvement,” he says in the video of the talk . “And by the way, 10 to 15 percent improvements are not easy feats. You have to work hard to get 15 percent. At Google, we actually have a fundamental belief that that’s not the way to tackle opportunities.”

Thinking in 10x is Google’s development imperative, both in the amount of data it can process and the reach of its products and services. According to Pichette, who also leads the Google Fiber group, Google won’t even consider making a new product or providing a new service unless it will be used by a billion people. “If it’s not going to be at least one billion people, it’s probably not worth our time,” he says. “It puts an incredible filter on how you think about opportunities. And as a CFO, I have to tell you, it makes my job so much easer.”

One example of the “outlandish things” that come out of 10x thinking is Google Fiber. Pichette says the initiative to lay fiber optic cable in the ground and provide end users in select towns with blisteringly fast access to the Internet was initially was pooh-poohed by the so-called analysts, because, it was assumed, Google would use the same business model used by other Internet service providers. Nope.

What the analysts missed was the part where Google develops and runs the entire thing all by itself. “When you build an end-to-end stack, both my cost structure and my cost curve are completely different than anybody else’s,” Pichette says. “Everybody else’s is exactly the same cost, because they all assemble the same stuff. I’m in a completely different position, and I control my destiny, not only on cost, but also the pace at which I can innovate.”

Google Glass, the computer that resembles a pair of eyeglasses, is another example of 10x thinking. When it was first unveiled, nobody though it would do anything, Pichette says. But the idea of having voice-directed computer attached to your head, which frees up your hands, is clearly catching on, he says. “It’s going to morph into 17 different things in the next decade,” he says. “That’s the essence of 10x.”

Pichette encouraged the students to open their minds and realize the vast opportunities that exist before them. “We have a natural tendency as humans, when you think of search or the digital economy, [to say that] it’s mostly done. That’s the mindset, a natural instinct, that we have,” he says. “My message to you is, that’s the wrong premise. We’re really in early days. You should look at the world as the first inning of this… baseball game, which is the digital economy, which is big data, which is the opportunity around you.

“We only have a couple billion people with cell phones,” he continues. “There’s another five billion that will show up…They want a better life, and better tools, and they want amazing things. And the real question is, Who’s going to give it to them.? What’s it going to be? Here is the opportunity in front of you.”

Musings and rantings of Andrew Finn

The Best Fake Reference Email Ever

Tim (from Wait But Why) did a very funny thing to one of our oldest and best friends, and I felt compelled to post it (names and brands have been changed).

Tim (emailing to me and three of our high school friends, not including our friend Peter):

“I did a very fun thing today. Peter is applying for a job at a company called AwesomeCorp, and I happen to know someone who knows the head of the company, so i got in touch with him last night to put in a good word for peter. the email i sent was nice and thorough and made peter’s skills and personality look as good as possible, while being completely accurate.

but today when peter asked if he could see the email, i decided to write a fake email and forward it to peter and pretend that it was the email i sent. below is what i sent peter.

he had the best possible reaction, first texting about the job in general and avoiding the email, then he brought up the email and in a non-confrontational way joked that it may have gone a little too far. then i called him and pretended to be all shocked he didn’t like the email, saying “wait you really think so?? i just thought it would make it clear to him that you weren’t just another candidate!” and in his peter non-confrontational way basically was like, “uhhhhh yeah i don’t know i just think he might take what you said the wrong way…” and i let the whole thing go on for a while before finally telling him that it wasn’t the actual email i sent. then he was like, “OH THANK GOD.”

UNBELIEVABLY fun half hour of my life.”

———- Forwarded message ———- From: Tim Urban Date: Wed, Sep 13, 2017 at 2:45 AM Subject: Re: Jim, meet Tim Urban (Regarding Potential Hire) To: Jim, Jim@awesomecorp.com

Nice to meet you Jim!

I wanted to shoot you a quick note about a close friend named Peter Jones who’s currently applying for a job at AwesomeCorp (in food service sales – I think he had his first interview yesterday or today). I’ve known Peter forever. Here’s his deal:

Peter is a psycho. A true, legitimate psycho—someone you need to actually keep away from your children. That’s how competitive and intense he is. This goes way back for him. When he and I and a bunch of our other friends took up poker during college, Peter took it to a whole other level, reading multiple poker books, playing constantly, and becoming a full-fledged addict we were worried about. When we started playing fantasy football, it took over Peter’s existence and he won our 12-person league three years in a row before finally forcing himself to quit because it was destroying his entire life. Then he entered the working world, starting out as a SweetBiz salesman, doing demos at fairs and expos. He became maniacally obsessed with it. Then he moved into the world of food service sales, joining a startup called FoodieCo where his job was to build a food service revenue stream from scratch. He was there for about a year and his wife and kids basically stopped seeing him. Then he began working at a company that sells sauces and soups to restaurants, and he doesn’t even like the company or the product but he still talks about it like a insane person. If I didn’t know him I’d recommend him for an insane asylum. Actually.

AwesomeCorp needs this guy – he might scare your staff a little with his intensity, but trust me, he’ll make deals. Big deals. He has a one-track mind.

Okay done. Sorry this was so long, but you need this guy!

Tim

Elliptic curves: point doubling

Written by Dominik Joe Pantůček on March 22, 2018.

After the introduction of the first two simple point operations on elliptic curves in simple Weierstrass form, we can now look at some more interesting operations available to us. Last of the three “primitive” operations specified for points of the elliptic curve is the point doubling operation. It should be the same as if we wanted to sum not two distinct but rather two equal points. As usually, I would like to encourage anyone to give me a feedback, especially about the visualizations used.

■ ■ ■

Elliptic curves: point addition

Another week, another point operation on elliptic curves. This time we are about to explore a simple point addition of two different points on elliptic curve in simple Weierstrass form. Although there are still some possibilities of enhancing the visualizations, our focus is now on finishing this series to a point where we can show at least Diffie-Hellman key exchange [1] .

Elliptic curves: point negation

Written by Dominik Joe Pantůček on March 8, 2018.

Venturing closer to our goal of using elliptic curves for digital signatures and encryption, we describe the simplest point operation on elliptic curve in Weierstrass form. This operation is called negation and it somehow resembles the negation of numbers you learned about in elementary school. We have (sort of) finalized the software stack for visualizing elliptic curves both in 2D or 3D so I would like to hear some feedback if the pictures – and especially the video – are clear and easy to understand. And now for something completely negating…

Elliptic curves over finite fields

Written by Dominik Joe Pantůček on March 1, 2018.

After a quick introduction to simple elliptic curves used in cryptography and finally for securing our online communication , we cannot move forward without solving one major problem. How to represent these curves, and all of their points thereof, in computer memory. Why this is a major problem? There is an infinite number of real numbers, but computers can store only a finitely-sized things – including numbers. I’d like to explain how we can overcome this inherent trouble and show you that anyone can understand these modern cryptographic fundamentals.

Introduction to elliptic curves

Written by Dominik Joe Pantůček on February 22, 2018.

We are about to start a journey to the realm of elliptic curve cryptography. It may seem strange at this point as why we should bother with that, but rest assured that we will eventually find out how to use this knowledge to secure our email communication . In this introduction, you can expect to see what an elliptic curve looks like, how it is defined and how it can be simplified if we want to make some practical use of it.

After the introduction of the first two simple point operations on elliptic curves in simple Weierstrass form, we can now look at some more interesting operations available to us. Last of the three “primitive” operations specified for points of the elliptic curve is the point doubling operation. It should be the same as if we wanted to sum not two distinct but rather two equal points. As usually, I would like to encourage anyone to give me a feedback, especially about the visualizations used.

26 Man Squad Named Ahead Of Edf Energy Cup

Wed, 19/03/2008 - 12:00

Rugby

Head Coach Lyn Jones has named a 26 man squad in preparation for Saturday's EDF Energy Cup Semi-Final against Saracens at the Millennium Stadium (KO 5.15pm).

13 of the Ospreys 14 Grand Slam winners are named in the preliminary squad, with just second row Ian Gough missing out after playing an integral role in the Welsh forward efforts over the last six weeks.

Lyn Jones said: "" Ian Gough has had a particularly heavy affair over the last six weeks or so, so it's in the best interests of Ian and the Ospreys that we give him a week off to recuperate and come back a bit stronger and to be at his best.""

Ospreys squad: L. Byrne, N. Walker, S. Williams, J. Vaughton, A.

Bishop, S. Parker G. Henson, D. Biggar, J. Spratt, J Hook, M.

UA Strengthens Partnership with Gadsden State

TUSCALOOSA, Ala. – The University of Alabama and President Stuart R. Bell recently hosted leaders from community colleges around Alabama, including Gadsden State Community College President Kathy Murphy, as part of UA’s continuous effort to build and nurture the partnership between the Capstone and two-year institutions.

“The University of Alabama views Gadsden State Community College as a strategic partner and we’re always looking for new ways to develop this special connection,” said Dr. Matthew McLendon, UA associate vice president and director of enrollment management. “Supporting transfer students from Gadsden State is an important part of our enrollment strategy. As the state’s flagship university, it provides us another avenue to serve students.”

During the event held at the President’s Mansion, Murphy and leaders from several community colleges had the opportunity to engage in conversation with Bell on ways to strengthen the bond between their institutions and the University.

“Gadsden State Community College is delighted to partner with the University of Alabama to ensure a seamless transition for our students from being a community college graduate to becoming a university student,” said Dr. Kathy Murphy, president. “Our top priority at Gadsden State is student success, so we are always interested in helping our students advance their careers and improve their future, whether it’s through direct entry into the workforce or transferring to a four-year university to continue their education. Our partnership with UA is certainly appreciated.”

According to the University’s six-year graduation rate data, 70% of transfer students will earn their undergraduate degree from UA while simultaneously receiving credits for their associate degree they started at their respective community college.

“One immediate value for students who transfer to UA before earning their associate degree is students will have the option to have their University of Alabama credits transferred back to the two-year institution for evaluation and determination of eligibility for an associate degree,” said McLendon.

“Additionally, the overall support services the University provides to the student body, along with our wide range of academic programs, make coming to UA a great choice for those students who wish to earn an undergraduate degree.”

According to the nationally recognized First Destination Survey, 90% of those surveyed in UA’s May 2020 graduating class reported a positive outcome, such as full- or part-time employment, continuing education, military service or volunteer service, following graduation. Some of the top 10 employers included UA, Lockheed Martin, Dell Technologies and Children’s of Alabama, among others.

UA will host the fourth annual ACHIEVE Alabama Transfer Student Success Conference March 2-3. The virtual conference will bring together administrators, faculty and staff from two-year and four-year institutions across the state to foster collaboration to ensure student success and increase college completion rates.

The virtual conference is free and registration is available via the conference website or by calling 205-348-9966. Participants can submit proposals for session presentations until Feb. 1.

UA is a student-centered research university and an academic community united in its commitment to enhance the quality of life for all Alabamians and the citizens of the nation and the world through the creation, translation and dissemination of knowledge with an emphasis on quality programs in the areas of teaching, research and service.

TUSCALOOSA, Ala. – The University of Alabama and President Stuart R. Bell recently hosted leaders from community colleges around Alabama, including Gadsden State Community College President Kathy Murphy, as part of UA’s continuous effort to build and nurture the partnership between the Capstone and two-year institutions.

“The University of Alabama views Gadsden State Community College as a strategic partner and we’re always looking for new ways to develop this special connection,” said Dr. Matthew McLendon, UA associate vice president and director of enrollment management. “Supporting transfer students from Gadsden State is an important part of our enrollment strategy. As the state’s flagship university, it provides us another avenue to serve students.”

During the event held at the President’s Mansion, Murphy and leaders from several community colleges had the opportunity to engage in conversation with Bell on ways to strengthen the bond between their institutions and the University.

“Gadsden State Community College is delighted to partner with the University of Alabama to ensure a seamless transition for our students from being a community college graduate to becoming a university student,” said Dr. Kathy Murphy, president. “Our top priority at Gadsden State is student success, so we are always interested in helping our students advance their careers and improve their future, whether it’s through direct entry into the workforce or transferring to a four-year university to continue their education. Our partnership with UA is certainly appreciated.”

According to the University’s six-year graduation rate data, 70% of transfer students will earn their undergraduate degree from UA while simultaneously receiving credits for their associate degree they started at their respective community college.

“One immediate value for students who transfer to UA before earning their associate degree is students will have the option to have their University of Alabama credits transferred back to the two-year institution for evaluation and determination of eligibility for an associate degree,” said McLendon.

“Additionally, the overall support services the University provides to the student body, along with our wide range of academic programs, make coming to UA a great choice for those students who wish to earn an undergraduate degree.”

According to the nationally recognized First Destination Survey, 90% of those surveyed in UA’s May 2020 graduating class reported a positive outcome, such as full- or part-time employment, continuing education, military service or volunteer service, following graduation.

Importance of STEM Education

STEM represents more than a list of traditional fields of study, it represents a powerful way of looking at the world. It underpins our ability to tackle critical global challenges and build inclusive prosperity. More people must be engaged with STEM to develop talent, solve difficult problems, tackle misinformation and build public trust in science.

In our latest Reports, we analyze the education system, present recommendations of what needs to change and why, and connect with youth to better understand their perspective on climate change so we can continue to develop programming that is progressive.

Xhaka celebrates scoring Arsenal's third goal

AFP

Arsenal became the first side to win nine London derbies in the same Premier League (PL) season as they eased to a 4-1 success over managerless Crystal Palace to remain on course for a first league title since 2003-04.

Keen to bounce back from their disappointing UEFA Europa League exit at the hands of Sporting CP on Thursday night, the Gunners were heavy favourites to see off a Palace side who are winless in 2023 - a record which resulted in the sacking of manager and Arsenal legend Patrick Vieira on Friday. Somewhat surprisingly, it was the PL’s lowest scorers who had the first two clear-cut opportunities, with Wilfried Zaha’s shot from inside the area coming back off the left post before Odsonne Edouard had his shot saved by Aaron Ramsdale in a one-on-one situation.

Mikel Arteta’s side aren’t top of the table for no reason though, and they went up a gear after their slow start to take command of the contest. First, Bukayo Saka’s ball across the area found Gabriel Martinelli , who controlled it and switched onto his left foot before firing past Joseph Whitworth and into the corner. Then, with HT approaching, the effervescent Saka went from provider to scorer when he latched onto Ben White’s through-ball and shot past Whitworth to give the hosts a comfortable lead at the break.

The Eagles knew it would be difficult to get back into the match, especially given Arsenal had lost just one of their last 16 home matches, and things got even worse 10 minutes after the restart when Granit Xhaka played a one-two with Leandro Trossard and got to the ball just before Joel Ward to direct it home from close range. Palace kept fighting though, and they pulled a goal back soon after when the ball landed at the feet of Jeffrey Schlupp from a corner, allowing the Ghanaian to divert it home from a few yards out.

Any hopes of an Eagles comeback were quashed with just over 15 minutes remaining though when Saka fired home his second of the afternoon to send Arsenal eight points clear at the summit, having played a game more than Manchester City, while Palace remain 12th.

Description

Amnesia Description

It has a great vigorous growth with strong side branches ready to hold the weight of the heavy flowers.

The plant is very resistant to most of the external problems related to growing such as mold/fungus or other pest infections which is very helpful, especially for outdoor growers.

During the flowering period, the plant expresses its beautiful pine tree shaped structure with short internodes that will allow many flower sites to develop. The flowers of the GH Amnesia are covered in shiny trichomes that will fill the room of citrusy aroma and they are very compact, producing conically shaped, heavy buds.

The flavors of the GH Amnesia are an intense mix of lemony aromas combined with a creaminess that reminds of freshly pressed olive oil and is complemented by light nutty and hazey notes on the inhale. The room will instantly be filled with the smell of the flower when burning , a very distinct and potent smell that is very particular to the Amnesia and which will last for a while in the air and in your palate.

When It Matters

It's time. Playoff baseball is here. This is when I live for live betting. Every pitch counts in the postseason, so you know everyone is trying their best at all times. The best teams playing to win. Its a lot better than regular season games when guys might mail it in some nights. Looking forward to spending my fall on BetUS making some cash.

Man this site is fantastic. I spend time before during and after games checking out the odds and making bets. Betus knows what they're doing and provides me with everything I need to make winning bets on any sport I want. You cant find a better online sportsbook. I know because I tried. Betus is my home for as long as I bet on sports.

Ready For Breeders’

It’s getting so close to the Breeders’ Cup. I love those two days every year. Better betting days than the Triple Crown races put together. BetUS has had some odds up for a while now, but I keep waiting to see what I want to go with. I follow all the races on the BetUS race book, and love that all the races are covered and are able to bet on on this sportsbook. I’ll be ready for make some bets thanks to BetUS, and that’s the only place I’ll be making those bets.

Great To PLay

If a site makes things hard for you to find your bets and make your bets, you don’t want to come back. BetUS does just the opposite, making things simple for anyone who comes on to get on, make their deposits, make their bets and win. I love coming on this site and finding the bets I want to make, and then I look around and find more to do. This site is a great place to make bets on any sports you want.

I’m so excited to bet on the Match. I see BetUS has an overall bet between Brooks and DeChambeau, but I know there are going to be more bets coming. These two are going to be talking trash and I’ll be here for every moment of it. I really hope they don’t kiss and make up before the Match. Let’s let the bad blood continue. Should make for a much better match for all of us. I’ll be here ready to make my bets per hole when the match starts.

Not Just The Good

One of the tips I’ve used the most since I started sports betting is that it’s not always betting on the winning team that gets you winning bets. Taking the under for a bad team works just as well. I like that BetUS has over/unders for both teams in a football game. I can bet on the Jets getting the under and most games, I’m going to get a win. I always thought “picking winners” was about picking the winning team, but it’s more about picking winning bets. Since I started looking at it differently, I’ve been winning more bets on your site, and I love this new hobby.

Deal em

The best part of the betus site in my opinion is the poker rooms. I spend hours playing against real players making real money. No computer players. Nobody just going all-in every time. This is real poker that you have to play to win. I love the tournaments as well as the sit and go's. Betus has so much to offer, I never get enough.

Mile High Magic

Some people dont like basketball starting up earlier each year. Me, I love it. More time for me to make some bets. I love my Nuggets and I'm feeling good about my championship bet on them on BetUS. Murray is back and healthy, Jokic will be MVP (made that bet too) and porter is just going to be better. Forget the LA teams. Denver is winning this year.

Learning As I Go

The esports available on BetUS are fantastic. I’d never been into esports before I ventured into that section on your site. I’ve been watching and learning and getting familiar with the top teams and players. And I’m starting to take my chance on some bets and winning. I’m excited to keep learning and getting better. It’s more fun than most sports betting, and it’s my first destination whenever I sign into the site.

The best part of the betus site in my opinion is the poker rooms. I spend hours playing against real players making real money. No computer players. Nobody just going all-in every time. This is real poker that you have to play to win. I love the tournaments as well as the sit and go's. Betus has so much to offer, I never get enough.

Some people dont like basketball starting up earlier each year. Me, I love it. More time for me to make some bets. I love my Nuggets and I'm feeling good about my championship bet on them on BetUS. Murray is back and healthy, Jokic will be MVP (made that bet too) and porter is just going to be better. Forget the LA teams. Denver is winning this year.

The esports available on BetUS are fantastic. I’d never been into esports before I ventured into that section on your site. I’ve been watching and learning and getting familiar with the top teams and players. And I’m starting to take my chance on some bets and winning. I’m excited to keep learning and getting better. It’s more fun than most sports betting, and it’s my first destination whenever I sign into the site.

BetUS delivers the most up to date odds and analysis, with the most up to the minute wagering opportunities for their clients. They also provide the most complete, rapid response customer service for our clients, along with fast payouts and easy depositing. You can check BetUS Sportsbook Reviews

Which online sportsbook is the best?

Many bettors across the globe will tell you that BetUS is the best sportsbook.

You can bet on any sport at BetUS. If they don’t have odds, you can ask and they will get them for you. They have all the major sports like football, basketball, soccer, hockey, baseball, MMA, and anything else you can think of.

Which sportsbooks have the quickest payouts?

The BetUS sportsbook approves payouts same-day Monday through Friday. You won’t find faster than that.

Yes. BetUS uses Vegas-style odds that are up to the minute, and they have a large variety of odds to wager on.

BetUS accepts deposits, allows wagers to be placed within their betting system and pays out winnings to those who win in their sportsbook, racebook and casino. So yes, BetUS is legit.

BetUS is a legally-licensed sportsbook, racebook and casino, with offices in San Jose and is regulated by the governments of Curacao & Costa Rica.

BetUS has offices in San Jose and is also licensed and regulated by the government of Curacao & Costa Rica.

Is sports betting a good way to make money?

If you can pick winners, sports betting is a good way to make money. At BetUS, you can bet on every sport, and you can parlay most on one betting slip. Parlays are a great way to win a lot of money if you can pick more than one winning team.

How do I get my money out of BetUS?

You can make withdrawals from BetUS via Cryptocurrencies, Bank wire, Check or MoneyGram.

Sports betting is a good idea if you want to make sports much more interesting and enjoyable. You do not have to bet huge sums of money on any game in order to use sports betting as a tool of enjoyment that can pay you handsomely when you pick winners.

Can I bet on sports from my phone?

BetUS has a mobile site you can bet from your phone on. It has everything their desktop site has, and is easy to use from wherever you are.

Third Party Verification Service

Welcome to everything you ever wanted to know about Verbatim TPV phone recording system but didn't know to ask! From our promise of a quick start and short ramp-up time to the securely archived records you can access when you need them, we'll relay the facts about our uniquely reliable voice logging system. You'll hear all about script changes, multi-lingual options, website or phone access to records, emailed reports of call activity and more as you get details on our third party verification service that will keep you in compliance, protect your business, or both.

Order Verification Service

We started back in 1995 doing something completely different. Regulatory bodies were requiring a witness to sales exchanges, especially for communications companies, and live voice-operated third party verification service options not only multiplied, they also got more expensive. We wanted to help businesses respond to requirements for order verification service without losing loads of capital, so we took our understanding of automated recording options and digital technology, and we created Verbatim TPV. Ever since, compliance has been affordable and much more reliable. Read on to learn more.

Voice Logging System

Perhaps you don't fall under the regulations but you want to have records of agent-customer interchange anyway. Maybe you've encountered one too many disputes along the way, disagreements that could easily have been resolved with a clear recording from an order verification service. If that's the case, you'll be glad to know that making this move won't cost you an arm and a leg, and it won't take very long to get started. You won't need special equipment and you won't have trouble changing the script to reflect changes in your business and product offerings. Finally, you won't be jumping through hoops to access records from this voice logging system .

You will have a pay-as-you-go 3rd party verifier service that can advance the efforts of your sales agents and protect your assets, whether you're required to be compliant or not. The articles that follow will relay the details about this simple system, so read on. Or you can contact us and get started now.

Keeping it Clean – Tips for Caring for Your E-Cigs and Vaporizers

Posted by Ashley on 2/2/2016 to News

Considering you use and handle them daily, put them to your lips, and store them in a pocket or purse with money and other not-so-sanitary things, your e-cigs and vaporizers probably need a bit of cleaning now and then.

But don’t just polish up the exterior. The inside of your device can become dirty due to frequent use and it may need some occasional care to make sure it is working at its best and allowing you to experience the full pleasure of vaping.

Please note that before doing any cleaning it is important to check the manufacturer’s user manual that came with your device. Some manufacturers, such as SmokeTip, offer Cleaning Kits for sale. You want to be sure to not use any harsh cleaners that could damage the device. You also don’t want to open parts that should not be opened.

Most e-cigs and vaporizers in general will require little maintenance beyond charging the battery and replace e-liquid/cartridges. But at times the vapor output and battery life can be affected by the device getting a bit dirty. Here’s some tips on keeping your device in tip-top shape.

Battery The battery portion of an e-cig is enclosed and you should not attempt to open it. But for cleaning purposes, it is good to make sure the threaded portion of it that connects to the cartridge is free of grime. Connection points where the device’s parts meet or are screwed together, can collect remnants of oils from your hands, dust and lint, and other dirt and residue that can cause the two parts to not fit as tightly together.

Again, it is important to check with your device’s user manual, but in most cases using a damp cotton ball to wipe off these connection tips weekly is a good idea. If you notice that a cotton ball is failing to get the job done, you might want to try using a toothpick or tweezers to gently scrap and pull any dirt from the threads/crevices that help tightly connect the battery to the cartridge. Be gentle to ensure you don’t damage the threads at the connection point. And always make sure the parts are completely dry before reassembling your e-cig or vaporizer.

Cartridge The cartridge portion of an e-cig is the part that holds the e-liquid. Also known as a cartomizer, they can be pre-filled and disposable or refillable and reusable. In many cases, e-cigarettes only have two pieces – the battery and the e-liquid cartridge. If you use pre-filled cartridges, in general you will only occasionally have to clean the threaded end with a damp cotton ball. If you use refillable cartridges, you might wish to wipe the inside with a Q-tip or rolled-up tissue to remove the residue of old e-liquid. Many users do this in particular when switching to another flavor so that the old flavor doesn’t mix in. In general, you can simply your cleaning job by not overfilling the cartridge with e-liquid. If you do overfill the cartridge, you might need to gently blow through the cartridge to force the excess e-liquid out. Be sure to place a paper towel or tissue over the end to collect any liquid that comes out. Also, remember that nicotine can be easily absorbed through the skin. You should wash your hands with soap and water immediately if they come in contact with it.

You also will want to periodically check the cotton batting that is often used to absorb e-liquid within an e-cig or vaporizer. This batting can eventually lose its ability to collect moisture and should be replaced on occasion.

Mouthpiece At times some e-liquid residue can cling to the inside of your e-cig’s mouthpiece. This can reduce the amount of vapor that is inhaled and keep you from getting the satisfying plume you desire. Also, traces of food or drink, or germs, can easily end up on your mouthpiece and within it. The best way to limit this is to remove the mouthpiece from the device and clean it regularly. It’s a tight space inside the mouthpiece so you will need to take a small piece of tissue and roll it tightly with your fingers until it is narrow enough, yet still sturdy, to fit inside. Keep the tissue dry so that it doesn’t break up in the mouthpiece. Any grime, dirt or leftover e-liquid should cling to the tissue and be removed when you pull the tissue out.

As mentioned above, e-cigs and vaporizers are largely maintenance-free. But a little cleaning now and then can make sure you always get a satisfying and tasty vape and extend the life of your device.

Keeping it Clean – Tips for Caring for Your E-Cigs and Vaporizers

Considering you use and handle them daily, put them to your lips, and store them in a pocket or purse with money and other not-so-sanitary things, your e-cigs and vaporizers probably need a bit of cleaning now and then.

But don’t just polish up the exterior. The inside of your device can become dirty due to frequent use and it may need some occasional care to make sure it is working at its best and allowing you to experience the full pleasure of vaping.

Please note that before doing any cleaning it is important to check the manufacturer’s user manual that came with your device. Some manufacturers, such as SmokeTip, offer Cleaning Kits for sale. You want to be sure to not use any harsh cleaners that could damage the device. You also don’t want to open parts that should not be opened.

Most e-cigs and vaporizers in general will require little maintenance beyond charging the battery and replace e-liquid/cartridges. But at times the vapor output and battery life can be affected by the device getting a bit dirty. Here’s some tips on keeping your device in tip-top shape.

Battery The battery portion of an e-cig is enclosed and you should not attempt to open it. But for cleaning purposes, it is good to make sure the threaded portion of it that connects to the cartridge is free of grime. Connection points where the device’s parts meet or are screwed together, can collect remnants of oils from your hands, dust and lint, and other dirt and residue that can cause the two parts to not fit as tightly together.

Again, it is important to check with your device’s user manual, but in most cases using a damp cotton ball to wipe off these connection tips weekly is a good idea. If you notice that a cotton ball is failing to get the job done, you might want to try using a toothpick or tweezers to gently scrap and pull any dirt from the threads/crevices that help tightly connect the battery to the cartridge. Be gentle to ensure you don’t damage the threads at the connection point. And always make sure the parts are completely dry before reassembling your e-cig or vaporizer.

Cartridge The cartridge portion of an e-cig is the part that holds the e-liquid. Also known as a cartomizer, they can be pre-filled and disposable or refillable and reusable. In many cases, e-cigarettes only have two pieces – the battery and the e-liquid cartridge. If you use pre-filled cartridges, in general you will only occasionally have to clean the threaded end with a damp cotton ball. If you use refillable cartridges, you might wish to wipe the inside with a Q-tip or rolled-up tissue to remove the residue of old e-liquid. Many users do this in particular when switching to another flavor so that the old flavor doesn’t mix in. In general, you can simply your cleaning job by not overfilling the cartridge with e-liquid. If you do overfill the cartridge, you might need to gently blow through the cartridge to force the excess e-liquid out. Be sure to place a paper towel or tissue over the end to collect any liquid that comes out. Also, remember that nicotine can be easily absorbed through the skin. You should wash your hands with soap and water immediately if they come in contact with it.

You also will want to periodically check the cotton batting that is often used to absorb e-liquid within an e-cig or vaporizer. This batting can eventually lose its ability to collect moisture and should be replaced on occasion.

Mouthpiece At times some e-liquid residue can cling to the inside of your e-cig’s mouthpiece. This can reduce the amount of vapor that is inhaled and keep you from getting the satisfying plume you desire. Also, traces of food or drink, or germs, can easily end up on your mouthpiece and within it. The best way to limit this is to remove the mouthpiece from the device and clean it regularly. It’s a tight space inside the mouthpiece so you will need to take a small piece of tissue and roll it tightly with your fingers until it is narrow enough, yet still sturdy, to fit inside. Keep the tissue dry so that it doesn’t break up in the mouthpiece. Any grime, dirt or leftover e-liquid should cling to the tissue and be removed when you pull the tissue out.

As mentioned above, e-cigs and vaporizers are largely maintenance-free. But a little cleaning now and then can make sure you always get a satisfying and tasty vape and extend the life of your device.",3.5,875

The 8 Best Islands in Greece for Beaches

Crete

Balos Beach in Chania Crete

Crete is the largest island in Greece, offering endless possibilities for any type of traveler. In Crete, you will arguably find most of the best beaches in all the Greek islands. Chania’s region features pristine nature, wild landscapes with crystal-clear cyan waters, and great beaches and coves. The rest of Crete is also known for its canyons, leading to stunning unorganized beaches with crystal-clear waters.

Here are some of the best beaches in Crete:

Elafonisi : The renowned Elafonisi beach is situated in the southwesternmost part of Crete. This lagoon with its pink sand and 1-meter depth seawater looks like a separate islet but is actually a peninsula.

The endless dunes, crystal-clear waters, and virgin nature is protected by Natura 2000 as a vital habitat for different species of flora and fauna, including Caretta-caretta turtles. The beach is accessible by car and is a 1.5-hour-drive from Chania.

Balos : You will find Balos lagoon 17 km outside of Kissamos and roughly 56 km northwest of the town of Chania. Balos is another pink beach in Crete , and among the best beaches in all Greek islands.

The turquoise waters are unparalleled, and the landscape is wild and untamed, with thick white sand and pink sand in some spots. You may even find Caretta-caretta turtles on its shores.

Falassarna Beach

Falassarna: Falassarna region is 59km outside of Chania and 17km from Kissamos, split into 5 beaches, the most famous of which is Pachia Ammos.

You can find amenities, including drinks and snacks under the protection of umbrellas, as well as sunbeds. For a quieter day at the beach, head to the remote coves nearby and enjoy tranquility on the sand.

Preveli : Another stunning beach of Crete is Preveli, situated just 35km south of Rethymnon. It is located where the large Kourtaliotiko gorge meets the Cretan Sea, where the river Mega Potamos flows.

On the river banks and behind the beach is a thick palm forest of rare Cretan palms (Phoenix Theophrasti). There are no amenities whatsoever aside from a snack bar. The shore is partly sandy and partly pebbly, and just 200 meters in length.

Vai Beach

Vai : Vai beach is located among the thick palm forest of Vai, with thousands of visitors every year, who flock there to enjoy the exotic atmosphere and large sandy shore.

To get there, you will have to drive for about 2 hours from Heraklion, to find the beach and the forest located 24 km east of Sitia. The beach is very well organized, with amenities, beach bars, restaurants, and water sports facilities as well.

Check out: The best beaches in Crete .

Milos

Sarakiniko Milos

Milos is perhaps the top Greek island with the best beaches to visit and enjoy pristine emerald waters surrounding the volcanic beauty of white stones and steep cliffs.

Sarakiniko : Among the most visited and photographed places on the island is Sarakiniko beach, known for the peculiarly shaped white-shaped rocks, creating arched-shaped caves to dive into. The crystal-clear emerald waters are out of this world!

You can access it by road, as it is located along the coastal road in the eastern part of Adamas in northeast Milos.

Firiplaka Beach in Milos

Firiplaka : Firiplaka is a long sandy/pebbly beach of deep, crystalline, turquoise water. The sand is almost silvery surrounded by steep rocks along the coastline. The beach gives off an exotic atmosphere thanks to the strong contrasts, and the seabed is interesting for snorkeling.

There are sunbeds and parasols there, but also free space if you want peace and quiet. There is road access to the beach and a bus route that makes a stop there for visitors.

Papafragkas Cave

Papafragkas : Three kilometers from Pollonia, you will find Papafragkas, a narrow beach, and a cave with the same name, which is formed between fjords and peculiar rock formations. The beach is remote and you can get there by descending a natural path of medium difficulty. The wild landscape and the caves of the beach are worth it!

Check out: The best beaches in Milos .

Naxos

Agios Prokopios Beach

Naxos is another jewel of the Cyclades and worth a visit, as it’s another one of the best islands in Greece for beaches. While in Naxos, you can’t miss Portara, the imposing ‘great door’ made out of marble, which is a remnant of the ancient Temple of Apollo in antiquity.

Agios Prokopios : Perhaps the most famous beach on this Greek island, Agios Prokopios beach is a well-organized paradise with sunbeds and parasols for travelers of all types, including families, couples, and groups of friends. You can find it just 4 km away from the main port of Naxos.

The coarse sand is endless and offers itself for beach rackets and beach volleyball, and the waters are ideal, with emerald and turquoise hues, crystal-clear and usually calm.

Agia Anna Beach

Agia Anna : The busy beach of Agia Anna is the continuation of Agios Prokopios. The beach is also sandy and well-organized, with beach bars, umbrellas, and sunbeds. The waters are inviting, and usually somewhat wavy, although there is a protected cove you can head to on windy days.

Access to the beach is easy by road, and there is also public transportation daily.

Plaka Beach

Plaka : The white sand and turquoise waters are not missing from Plaka beach, as well. This 4-kilometer-long and wide beach is ideal. Plaka used to be a nudist beach, and although now it is popular for all, there are still fans of nudism around, enjoying pristine nature.

You can get to Plaka by following the asphalt road towards Agios Prokopios, and then continue on a seaside dirt road for several kilometers.

Check out: The best beaches in Naxos .

Mykonos

Ornos Beach in Mykonos

Cosmopolitan Mykonos is one of the best Greek islands to visit for its stunning beaches, renowned for the lush beach partying, luxury, and youthful atmosphere.

Psarou : One of the trendiest and best beaches in the Greek islands is Psarou in Mykonos, where countless visitors enjoy emerald waters and the luxury of Nammos, a very famous and high-class beach bar. You can find various restaurants and accommodation options. Access is easy, but parking is difficult during the high season. You can also get there by bus.

Psarou Beach

Ornos : Ornos beach is a family-friendly, very well-organized beach in Mykonos. It has great amenities, with lots of restaurants, beach bars with sunbeds and parasols, and luxurious hotels. The shore is sandy and wide and you can get there by car in 10 minutes (from Mykonos town).

Super Paradise beach in Mykonos

Super Paradise : Super Paradise is also among the best beaches in the Greek islands, but for beach partying, clubbing, and dancing all day. The beach is sandy and filled with parasols, sunbeds, and other beach furniture to lounge in and enjoy cocktails by the sea. Although crowded, the seawater is heavenly and shallow. Access is easy by road.

Check out: The best Mykonos beaches .

Kefalonia

Myrtos Beach

Kefalonia is perhaps the crown jewel of the Ionian Sea, popular as one of the best Greek islands for beaches and exotic waters. Like the rest of the islands, it features stunning mirror-like waters of amazing blue hues, and lush green vegetation surrounding the steep cliffs.

Myrtos : Myrtos is justifiably one of the most beautiful beaches of Europe, its beauty untamed and otherworldly. Tall mountainous terrain and steep cliffs stop abruptly to a stunning white sandy/pebbly beach of the purest azure water. There are no amenities whatsoever, that’s why the landscape is unspoiled. You can get there by car but the road is not very good, and once there, know that the descend to swim is abrupt and challenging.

Antisamos Beach

Antisamos : You will find the pristine beach close to the port of Sami , among the greenest hills. The waters are a rich turquoise, the shore sandy and organized, known from the famous movie “Captain Corelli’s Mandolin.” The beach has a side for secluded sunbathing and nature lovers. You can get there easily by road from Sami port.

Xi Beach

Xi : A beach, unlike all others, Xi beach in Kefalonia has distinct white rocky surroundings contrasting with a brownish, almost red sand. Well organized with shallow waters and small waves, it is very family-friendly and convenient. You can get there by car or by bus from Lixouri or Argostoli.

Check out: The best beaches in Kefalonia.

Zakynthos

famous Navagio beach in Zante

The Ionian beauty of Zakynthos also offers two of the best beaches on the Greek islands. The distinct character of Zante is interwoven with its lovely beaches, ideal for sunbathing and swimming, as well as sightseeing and active adventure.

Navagio Beach : The highlight of the island one of the most photographed places in Greece, and even worldwide, is the famous Navagio of Zakynthos, a virgin beach with a rusty shipwreck, accessible only by boat.

The waters are the endless bright blue of the Ionian, and the sight of the shipwreck imposing and awe-inspiring.

Porto Zoro Beach

Porto Zoro Beach : Located around 17 km outside of Zakynthos town, Porto Zoro beach is ideal for a peaceful swim in lovely waters, away from the fuss of the crowds. The landscape has lush vegetation and peculiar rock formations, ideal for snorkeling. There is a hotel at the beach with lots of amenities, mostly for guests. You can get there easily by car.

Check out: The best beaches in Zakynthos.

Lefkada

Egremni Beach

One of the best islands in Greece for beaches is Lefkada , its Ionian beauty unparalleled and its landscapes breathtakingly raw. Although it is easily accessible from mainland Greece and tends to get crowded, its beaches remain untouched.

Porto Katsiki : In the southeastern side of Lefkada, after a long drive on a challenging road with turns, you will find Porto Katsiki, a long pebbly beach of unparalleled beauty, just below the steepest of cliffs. The open seawater is a cobalt blue that almost blinds you, its temperature refreshing all year round.

The beach is not organized with sunbeds and umbrellas, but you will find an organized parking space and two beach bars before the long staircase down the beach.

Porto Katsiki

Egremni : Even more untouched and wild, Egremni beach, just some kilometers before Porto Katsiki, is a breathtaking cliff (as the name suggests) ending to the most pristine beach in Lefkada. Access to the beach was cut when huge rocks fell, but now it is restored. And yet, it still is very challenging to descend there. The lovely view of a wide, almost endlessly long pebbly beach is surely worth it.

Kathisma Beach

Kathisma : In the same part of the island, you will find Kathisma beach, another long beach with crystal-clear waters. Unlike the other two, Kathisma is the most organized beach on the island, packed with well-arranged sunbeds and parasols to chill by the waves. The sea is very open and prone to strong waves and currents. There are many amenities, including watersports and a lifeguard on watch.

Check out: Best beaches in Lefkada.

Skiathos

Koukounaries Beach in Skiathos

Last but not least, Skiathos is also among the best Greek islands for beaches, much like its neighboring Skopelos. Here, you will find youthful travelers, couples, and groups of friends who want to enjoy pristine nature and some partying combined.

Koukounaries : As the name suggests, rich vegetation of lush pines surrounds the beach, making it the most stunning and most visited beach in Skiathos. It is crammed with people who enjoy its turquoise waters, as well as the amenities and services of the beach bars and water sports facilities.

Behind the beach, inside the forest, there is a protected biotope with rich flora and fauna, developed to promote ecotourism.

Lalaria Beach in Skiathos

Lalaria : Lalaria beach is only accessible by boat, thanks to its remote location. Huge white cliffs meet the most emerald, mirror-like waters, unspoiled and virgin. The place gets many boat visitors who anchor there and enjoy its beauty.

The rock forms an arch-like underwater passage, and there are some caves nearby to explore.

Access to the beach is easy by road, and there is also public transportation daily.

Plaka : The white sand and turquoise waters are not missing from Plaka beach, as well. This 4-kilometer-long and wide beach is ideal. Plaka used to be a nudist beach, and although now it is popular for all, there are still fans of nudism around, enjoying pristine nature.

You can get to Plaka by following the asphalt road towards Agios Prokopios, and then continue on a seaside dirt road for several kilometers.

Cosmopolitan Mykonos is one of the best Greek islands to visit for its stunning beaches, renowned for the lush beach partying, luxury, and youthful atmosphere.

Psarou : One of the trendiest and best beaches in the Greek islands is Psarou in Mykonos, where countless visitors enjoy emerald waters and the luxury of Nammos, a very famous and high-class beach bar. You can find various restaurants and accommodation options. Access is easy, but parking is difficult during the high season. You can also get there by bus.

Ornos : Ornos beach is a family-friendly, very well-organized beach in Mykonos. It has great amenities, with lots of restaurants, beach bars with sunbeds and parasols, and luxurious hotels. The shore is sandy and wide and you can get there by car in 10 minutes (from Mykonos town).

Super Paradise : Super Paradise is also among the best beaches in the Greek islands, but for beach partying, clubbing, and dancing all day. The beach is sandy and filled with parasols, sunbeds, and other beach furniture to lounge in and enjoy cocktails by the sea. Although crowded, the seawater is heavenly and shallow. Access is easy by road.

Kefalonia is perhaps the crown jewel of the Ionian Sea, popular as one of the best Greek islands for beaches and exotic waters. Like the rest of the islands, it features stunning mirror-like waters of amazing blue hues, and lush green vegetation surrounding the steep cliffs.

Myrtos : Myrtos is justifiably one of the most beautiful beaches of Europe, its beauty untamed and otherworldly. Tall mountainous terrain and steep cliffs stop abruptly to a stunning white sandy/pebbly beach of the purest azure water. There are no amenities whatsoever, that’s why the landscape is unspoiled. You can get there by car but the road is not very good, and once there, know that the descend to swim is abrupt and challenging.

Antisamos : You will find the pristine beach close to the port of Sami , among the greenest hills. The waters are a rich turquoise, the shore sandy and organized, known from the famous movie “Captain Corelli’s Mandolin.” The beach has a side for secluded sunbathing and nature lovers. You can get there easily by road from Sami port.

Xi : A beach, unlike all others, Xi beach in Kefalonia has distinct white rocky surroundings contrasting with a brownish, almost red sand. Well organized with shallow waters and small waves, it is very family-friendly and convenient. You can get there by car or by bus from Lixouri or Argostoli.

The Ionian beauty of Zakynthos also offers two of the best beaches on the Greek islands. The distinct character of Zante is interwoven with its lovely beaches, ideal for sunbathing and swimming, as well as sightseeing and active adventure.

Navagio Beach : The highlight of the island one of the most photographed places in Greece, and even worldwide, is the famous Navagio of Zakynthos, a virgin beach with a rusty shipwreck, accessible only by boat.

The waters are the endless bright blue of the Ionian, and the sight of the shipwreck imposing and awe-inspiring.

Porto Zoro Beach : Located around 17 km outside of Zakynthos town, Porto Zoro beach is ideal for a peaceful swim in lovely waters, away from the fuss of the crowds. The landscape has lush vegetation and peculiar rock formations, ideal for snorkeling. There is a hotel at the beach with lots of amenities, mostly for guests. You can get there easily by car.

One of the best islands in Greece for beaches is Lefkada , its Ionian beauty unparalleled and its landscapes breathtakingly raw. Although it is easily accessible from mainland Greece and tends to get crowded, its beaches remain untouched.

Porto Katsiki : In the southeastern side of Lefkada, after a long drive on a challenging road with turns, you will find Porto Katsiki, a long pebbly beach of unparalleled beauty, just below the steepest of cliffs. The open seawater is a cobalt blue that almost blinds you, its temperature refreshing all year round.

The beach is not organized with sunbeds and umbrellas, but you will find an organized parking space and two beach bars before the long staircase down the beach.

Egremni : Even more untouched and wild, Egremni beach, just some kilometers before Porto Katsiki, is a breathtaking cliff (as the name suggests) ending to the most pristine beach in Lefkada. Access to the beach was cut when huge rocks fell, but now it is restored. And yet, it still is very challenging to descend there. The lovely view of a wide, almost endlessly long pebbly beach is surely worth it.

Kathisma : In the same part of the island, you will find Kathisma beach, another long beach with crystal-clear waters. Unlike the other two, Kathisma is the most organized beach on the island, packed with well-arranged sunbeds and parasols to chill by the waves. The sea is very open and prone to strong waves and currents. There are many amenities, including watersports and a lifeguard on watch.

Last but not least, Skiathos is also among the best Greek islands for beaches, much like its neighboring Skopelos. Here, you will find youthful travelers, couples, and groups of friends who want to enjoy pristine nature and some partying combined.

Koukounaries : As the name suggests, rich vegetation of lush pines surrounds the beach, making it the most stunning and most visited beach in Skiathos. It is crammed with people who enjoy its turquoise waters, as well as the amenities and services of the beach bars and water sports facilities.

Behind the beach, inside the forest, there is a protected biotope with rich flora and fauna, developed to promote ecotourism.

Lalaria : Lalaria beach is only accessible by boat, thanks to its remote location. Huge white cliffs meet the most emerald, mirror-like waters, unspoiled and virgin. The place gets many boat visitors who anchor there and enjoy its beauty.

The rock forms an arch-like underwater passage, and there are some caves nearby to explore.

Rutgers Cinema strictly prohibits food or drinks of any kind in the theater. Food and drinks must be given to management who will return these items upon the customer’s exiting of the theater.

No Video or Photographic Equipment Allowed

Rutgers Cinema strictly prohibits the use of video and camera equipment (of any type) in the theater due to film studio policies regarding film piracy.

Any ticket exchange is at the discretion of theater management and can only be conducted at the theater. If a refund is available, management will only refund to you the ticket price. If you also wish to request a refund of our Admin Fee in extraordinary circumstances as described above, you should contact Rutgers Cinema's customer service (otherwise, the Admin Fee is non-refundable, as stated above).

Aquionics UVSwim Now NSF/ ANSI Standard 50-2012 Certified

The UVSwim I line of pool and spa disinfection systems by Aquionics has become the first complete UV system range to achieve the new NSF/ ANSI Standard 50-2012 certification. The certification applies to all seven models of UVSwim I from 100+ to 4500+.

The NSF/ ANSI Standard 50-2012 certifies the design, construction and performance of the UVSwim I system, including the full inactivation of the parasite cryptosporidium. In addition to the new certification, all models also have approval to drinking water standards in the U.S. (U.S. EPA) and Germany (DVGW).

Water passing through the UVSwim I is exposed to specific wavelengths of UV light, which destroy microorganisms on a cellular level. When coupled with chlorine treatment, the system provides a highly effective second barrier against chlorine-resistant microorganisms such as cryptosporidium. The amount of chlorine required to maintain safe conditions is dramatically reduced. UV treatment also eliminates chloramines, the byproduct of chlorine disinfection that can damage pool equipment and cause skin and eye irritation.

Differences Between Poker And Caribbean Poker

by Gertrude Dugas December 12, 2022

The differences between poker and Caribbean Stud are mostly focused on game development. So, remember that the most important thing is to know when you should draw the cards and when you should bet.

The Dealer

In Caribbean Poker, the player faces only the dealer, not against the rest of the players as in traditional poker.

Game development

After making the first decision, the development of the games takes different paths. In poker, the bets continue; what’s more, at that first moment, you can start to climb.

Progressive Jackpots in Caribbean Poker

The existence of progressive jackpots is an aspect that gives more excitement to the game of Caribbean poker; however, if it is analyzed coldly, it is concluded that, really, they are not a great system to obtain great benefits, since it is necessary to place a bet like Ante.

If the pot has been around for a long time and the forecast is to continue playing another long period, perhaps you could consider the option of paying the Ante. Although to do it, everything is said, it would be more to pursue a utopia consisting of achieving an extraordinary prize than really a good strategy to win in the long term. That is, if you are willing to follow the most logical and generally productive Caribbean Stud strategy, you should not pay the Ante. If despite everything, you decide to do it, you have to know that the house advantage increases by 25%. Are you ready for it?

After checking his cards:

Abandon and lose the initial “Ante” bet.

Make a double ante bet and face your dealer’s hand.

When the tactic used is optimal, the house edge is set to approximately 5%. Therefore, the importance of the decision about whether or not to pay the Ante is noted.

If you scrutinize different games, it is found that, for example, on free slot machines, there is always an important advantage in favor of the house. Without a doubt, greater than the one held in Caribbean Poker in which, in addition, you can withdraw and, thus, minimize losses.

How to play Video Poker?

The video poker is a popular casino game. It could be said that it is a video game with a format similar to that of slot machines where the player competes against the machine. It is probably one of the few online casino games in which it is possible to defeat the machine.

Some versions have payout percentages greater than 99%.

Due to the great acceptance that poker is having among the public, many people decide to also enjoy this card game on video poker machines due to the speed of these compared to physical poker tables.

Variants of Video Poker

Despite the fact that most players prefer Jacks and Better, there are also other types of machines that are interesting to know. There are several versions of video poker: Deuces Wild, Joker Poker, 10s Or Better, and Two Ways Royal.

Look for a poker casino that has bonus rounds, a cumulative jackpot, and where you can play the Jacks or Better model, which is the one with the highest percentage of payouts: above 99%.

Do not worry if you spend, at least in the first days, part of your time choosing the best casino. Then you will appreciate it.

Video Poker Strategies

A player with an optimal Video Poker strategy can reduce the casino advantage to a really small percentage, whereas if correct basic rules are not applied, it will be almost impossible to beat the bank.

The perfect strategy has to do with each player and each game; however, here are some general tips:

Study the payments

It is convenient to know what is type of video poker offered by the casino where you want to play. That decision will depend on many of the victory options that you will have later.

Analyze the play

There is no time limit to choose the perfect move, so analyze it well, scan the cards as many times as necessary and press the key only when you are absolutely sure. A word of advice, don’t try to hold three cards to get a Color or a Straight.

Stay with the couples.

If you receive between the cards a pair and also four cards of the same suit, stay with the pair instead of risking and trying to go for the color.

Decide the time to play.

It is convenient to know the time you want to play to adapt the game to this fact.

The longer the gaming session, the better it is for the casino. In addition, the bets you place must be lower. If, as a player, you want to spend a lot of time playing, then single coin bets would be best for you.

If you are looking for a quick game, then use the maximum amount of coins since the prizes will be bigger, although you should know that in this way you may lose a significant amount of money in a very short time.

Before deciding whether to play just one coin or the maximum number of coins, a player must understand what the payouts and winning options are.

Progressive jackpots

If you want to win a progressive jackpot by playing Video Poker, you have to risk the maximum number of coins in each spin. Progressive jackpots are the most lucrative and difficult prizes to get in a casino. The player who is able to achieve it receives a really high amount of money.

If you are trying to get a progressive jackpot, you should know that the coins can disappear from your pocket at a really fast rate. Be careful and never exceed the losses you can assume, no matter how big the pot you get.

Decide how much to bet.

Before playing, it is convenient to analyze the budget you have. Decide how much money you are willing to lose or win in video poker.

Keep your budget under control. If you are running out of money and wanting to play, it is better to reduce the bet to a minimum to be able to extend the game session without breaking the bank.

A five-coin bet always pays five times more than a single-coin single bet. Even in large prizes, this proportion increases. Choose the amount to bet in each round, depending on your total budget.

The best video poker strategy is to know your own limits and never exceed them. The small step between exceeding the limits or not doing it can be the difference between enjoying video poker and having a problem.

We got these for our wedding and they were SO beautiful and such a great quality. Totally beats the cheap flip flops we see at most weddings. The box they come in is also gorgeous.

Jennifer

Amazing thing to have for my guests. Who wants to dance in painful heels all night?? I set a box beside the dance floor with a cute display and all the ladies loved them. I heard “What a great idea!” 50 times that night.

All guests are required to attend a safety briefing and orientation prior to skiing or snowboarding. An experienced staff member will brief the group on the skiing agenda, guide expectations, and answer any questions or concerns that the group may have.

Each guest will be equipped with a Barryvox Pulse avalanche transceiver which they will be trained to use in addition to other safety equipment. Guests also have the option to rent the Snow Pulse Airbag Backpack. Your guide will provide an overview on skiing in powder, brief you on the natural hazards associated with the backcountry (i.e. trees, cliffs, crevasses), and how to manage yourself safely in this environment. While you are out skiing, each member of your group will carry a pack including avalanche shovel and probe, and each skiing/boarding pair will have a radio. Your guide, and helicopter will carry additional safety and rescue equipment.

Our guides are trained to assess and manage avalanche hazard. They monitor and test snowpack stability on a regular basis. They also use a variety of snow science and weather observation tools to gather data and formulate daily operation plans. Each morning our guides and pilots attend a comprehensive meeting to select the appropriate terrain for each group based on the current weather and mountain conditions. Our guides and pilots are certified to the highest levels in their professions. They maintain constant radio contact with each other in the field, as well as with our base station through a radio repeater system.

Heli Skiing Safety

Heli Skiing Etiquette

Electronics Policy

Safety Pointers

Always listen to the guide’s instructions. Don’t hesitate to ask for clarification if uncertain.

We are in a remote mountain environment – look out for one another and act as a team.

Choose your own fresh ski/board line, but always add your tracks on to the left/right of the guide’s ski track (guide will confirm this instruction before each run). Always be aware of where you are in relation to your guides track, especially in the trees.

Give a minimum of 10 turns head start to the guide or other skiers ahead of you. Never ski below your guide.

Ski with a partner in the trees –your mutual safety depends on it. Tree wells are a serious hazard in the Selkirk and Monashee Mountains.

Do not use pole straps around wrist or hands – this is dangerous because poles can get snagged within the trees or become anchors if you are caught in an avalanche.

If you get lost from the rest of the group stay put and your guide will find you. If you keep skiing the situation may become worse.

No music devices – they interfere with communications with the guides and fellow skiers.

No cellphones – they interfere with the performance of your avalanche transceiver.

No drugs or alcohol during your ski day – strictly enforced. Please also try to limit consumption the evening before as well!

Ski Courtesy

Ski into re-grouping areas slowly and under control.

Take turns skiing behind your guide, in the middle of the group, and at the back.

Leave a minimum of 10 turns between skiers to avoid collisions.

Always ski in control. Most accidents are caused by skier collisions, or by hitting natural hazards.

Help fallen skiers with lost skis or equipment.

If a boarder is stuck on the flats, skiers can lend a pole or assist them with a push or helping hand. We also encourage snowboarders to ride with poles to assist them in the flats.

When flat areas are encountered, snowboarders have more success traversing at the back of the group where they can ride in ski tracks made by those in front.

Other

No loose items can be left in the helicopter so you need to ski with whatever you bring.

After you are finished your ski trip with us please return your skis/board and transceivers to the ski shop.

Please Note: Our STHS ski guides reserve the right to remove any skier/snowboarder from a heli ski group if the above Etiquette & Safety guidelines are not being complied with.

Electronic devices, metallic objects, as well as wireless signals have been found to adversely affect avalanche transceiver performance in both transmit and receive modes.

The following is a list of devices which are prohibited while skiing with STHS:

Electronics

Audio listening devices such as ear buds or built-in helmet speakers attached to any portable listening device.

Electronic devices with wireless capability e.g. GoPro Hero3+ and Smith IO Recon Goggles with wireless remote control. *Note: goggles and cameras can be used but remote controls for these devices are not permitted in the skiing environment.

Heart rate monitors.

Wrist watches with GPS capability and/or Bluetooth capability.

Any chest-mounted electronic device e.g. chest-mounted GoPro.

Any aerial electronic devices e.g. drone cameras

Clothing

Clothing with large magnetic buttons and/or large metallic belt buckles and adornments near the chest/waist.

Electrically heated gloves.

Any electrically heated clothing systems.

The following is a list of devices that may be taken into the helicopter skiing environment provided that the device(s) can be guaranteed to remain at least 20cm / 8 inches apart from the Pulse Barryvox transceiver at all times:

Cellular telephones* (see note below)

Portable radios such as the ones issued by Selkirk Tangiers.

Personal still picture and motion picture cameras.

Any metal object including foil wrappers on candy bars and cigarette packages.

*A Special Note on Cellular Telephones

It is important to note that there is no cellular service in our helicopter skiing terrain. Using the phone as a camera is allowed provided the following conditions are met:

The phone is always switched to AIRPLANE MODE and is turned OFF at all times, only to be turned ON to take pictures then promptly turned OFF

The phone must be kept a minimum 20cm / 8 inches away from the Pulse Barryvox transceiver at all times

In the event of an avalanche or lost skier search the following actions must be taken by all persons involved directly in the search:

Switch off all electronic equipment including cameras and cellular telephones

Ensure that all metal objects including electronics and cellular telephones remain at least 50cm / 20inches from the searching Pulse Barryvox transceivers

Helicopters & Pilots

Mustang Helicopters of Red Deer, Alberta, is our preferred carrier with Bell 205 and Eurocopter A-Star helicopters. These helicopters are inspected and serviced by qualified Mustang Helicopter engineers at our Revelstoke base.

All pilots have extensive mountain flying experience and prior to each ski season they attend an annual certification for helicopter skiing. Before loading the helicopter for the first flight, the pilot will give a detailed outline of procedures and protocol that guests are required to follow when in and around the aircraft.

Safety & Risk Awareness

Helicopter skiing, snowboarding, and other activities that take place in wilderness areas, involve the risk of injury. The information contained in the Safety & Risk Awareness section of the Heli Cat Canada website is intended to inform you of the risks, dangers and hazards you may encounter while helicopter skiing or snowboarding, and to help you stay safe while enjoying these activities. Whether you are a participant in these activities or a parent or guardian of a minor participant, please take the time to familiarize yourself with this Safety & Risk Awareness information.

Description

The Hatteras XL series combines the comforts of rustic style with the elegance of refined beauty in a 2.375"" solid wood frame. Distressed barnwood and weathered tones blend the natural wood browns and the aged whitewash for a Country Chic aesthetic. From Rustic to Farmhouse décor, the Hatteras XL Barndoor Brown picture frame is the perfect centerpiece for your space.

Our signature mat showcases a custom bevel-cut opening with a 0.05 inch thick cream core. The actual opening size will be reduced by 0.5 inches to prevent the image from falling through the opening. For example, a 4x6 ma opening will have an actual viewable area of 3.5x5.5. To attach your print to the matboard, center the image within the mat opening and secure the top side with an adhesive strip. Our pH neutral matboard maintains a professional appearance.

Note: The ""Frame Size"" dropdown menu above lists the frame opening first and the mat opening second. For example, ""5 x 7 / 4 x 6 Mat"" means that the 5x7 inch picture frame is matted to display a 4x6 inch image.

The Hatteras XL series combines the comforts of rustic style with the elegance of refined beauty in a 2.375"" solid wood frame. Distressed barnwood and weathered tones blend the natural wood browns and the aged whitewash for a Country Chic aesthetic. From Rustic to Farmhouse décor, the Hatteras XL Barndoor Brown picture frame is the perfect centerpiece for your space.

Our signature mat showcases a custom bevel-cut opening with a 0.05 inch thick cream core. The actual opening size will be reduced by 0.5 inches to prevent the image from falling through the opening. For example, a 4x6 ma opening will have an actual viewable area of 3.5x5.5. To attach your print to the matboard, center the image within the mat opening and secure the top side with an adhesive strip. Our pH neutral matboard maintains a professional appearance.

Note: The ""Frame Size"" dropdown menu above lists the frame opening first and the mat opening second. For example, ""5 x 7 / 4 x 6 Mat"" means that the 5x7 inch picture frame is matted to display a 4x6 inch image.
